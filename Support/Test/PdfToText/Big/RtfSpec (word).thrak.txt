Introduction 
The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within 
applications and for transfer between applications. Users often depend on special translation 
software to move word-processing documents between various applications developed by 
different companies. RTF serves as both a standard of data transfer between word processing 
software, document formatting, and a means of migrating content from one operating system to 
another. RTF allows documents to migrate forward and backward in time: old readers can read 
the most recent RTF and new readers can read old RTF. The only other widely used rich-text 
format that has this flexibility is HTML, which is not nearly as rich. 
This document specifies the format used by RTF for text and graphics interchange. RTF usually 
uses ASCII (lower byte range – 7 bits) to represent rich text, with runs of text that include 
nonASCII characters requiring conversion to appropriate code values. This version of the RTF 
Specification includes all control words introduced by Microsoft Office Word up through Word 
2007. For Microsoft Word for Windows® 95 on, the Index of RTF Control Words in Appendix B 
reveals the version of Word that added the control words. It also reveals the control words 
defined in the 1987 Microsoft Systems Journal RTF article. Files created with an earlier version 
of Word using RTF should be read without problem by newer versions of Word. Older versions of 
Word ignore control words and groups they don’t understand. 
Software that can convert rich text to RTF is called an RTF writer. An RTF writer separates the 
application’s control information from the actual text and writes a file containing the text and the 
RTF command groups associated with that text. Software that reads an RTF file and is capable of 
interpreting or discarding the formatting commands is called an RTF reader. 
A sample RTF parsing reader program is given in Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application. 
This sample RTF reader is designed for use in conjunction with this document to assist those 
interested in developing their own RTF readers. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, 
and Microsoft does not provide technical support or any other kind of support for the sample RTF 
parsing reader code or this document.  
Basic Entities 
RTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text, consisting of control words, control symbols, and 
groups. RTF files are easily transmitted between most PC based operating systems because of 
their 7-bit ASCII characters. However, converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for 
Windows or Microsoft Word for the Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters 
and binary data (see \binN) can contain any 8-bit values. Unlike most clear text files, an RTF 
file does not have to contain any carriage return/line feed pairs (CRLFs) and CRLFs should be 
ignored by RTF readers except that they can act as control word delimiters. RTF files are more 
readable when CRLFs occur at major group boundaries. 
Control Word 
An RTF control word is a specially formatted command used to mark characters for display on a 
monitor or characters destined for a printer. A control word’s name cannot be longer than 32 
letters.  
A control word is defined by: 
\<ASCII Letter Sequence><Delimiter> 
where <Delimiter> marks the end of the control word’s name. For example: 
\par Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Introduction 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 8 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
A backslash begins each control word and the control word is case sensitive. 
The <ASCII Letter Sequence> is made up of ASCII alphabetical characters (a through z and A 
through Z). Control words (also known as keywords) originally did not contain any uppercase 
characters, however in recent years uppercase characters appear in some newer control words. 
The <Delimiter> can be one of the following: 
 A space. This serves only to delimit a control word and is ignored in subsequent processing. 
 A numeric digit or an ASCII minus sign (-) which indicates that a numeric parameter is associated with 
the control word. The subsequent digital sequence is then delimited by any character other than an 
ASCII digit (commonly another control word that begins with a backslash)The parameter can be a 
positive or negative decimal number. The range of the values for the number is nominally –32768 
through 32767, i.e., a signed 16-bit integer. A small number of control words take values in the range 
−2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (32-bit signed integer). These control words include \binN, 
\revdttmN, \rsidN related control words and some picture properties like \bliptagN. Here N stands 
for the numeric parameter. An RTF parser must allow for up to 10 digits optionally preceded by a minus 
sign. If the delimiter is a space, it is discarded, that is, it’s not included in subsequent processing. 
 Any character other than a letter or a digit. In this case, the delimiting character terminates the control 
word and is not part of the control word. Such as a backslash “\”, which means a new control word or a 
control symbol follows. 
If a single space delimits the control word, the space does not appear in the document (it’s 
ignored). Any characters following the single space delimiter, including any subsequent spaces, 
will appear as text or spaces in the document. For this reason, you should use spaces only 
where necessary. It is recommended to avoid spaces as a means of breaking up RTF syntax to 
make it easier to read. You can use paragraph marks (CR, LF, or CRLF) to break up lines without 
changing the meaning except in destinations that contain \binN.  
In this document, a control word that takes a numeric parameter N is written with the N, as 
shown here for \binN, unless the control word appears with an explicit value. The only 
exceptions to this are “toggle” control words like \b (bold toggle), which have only two states. 
When such a control word has no parameter or has a nonzero parameter, the control word turns 
the property on. When such a control word has a parameter of 0, the control word turns the 
property off. For example, \b turns on bold and \b0 turns off bold. In the definitions of these 
toggle control words, the control word names are followed by an asterisk. 
Units 
The parameter N often specifies a dimension. The units used for dimensions in RTF may be 
points (pts), half pts, twips, Word device-independent units, EMUs, or pixels, depending on the 
control word. These units are summarized in the table 
 
Units Conversions 
Points (pts) 72/inch 
Half points 144/inch 
Twips 1440/inch, 20/pt 
Device-independent 294912/inch, 4096/pt 
EMUs 914400/inch, 36000/mm, 12700/pt, 635/twip  
Pixels typically 96/inch 
 
EMUs (English-Metric Units) are used for some drawing parameter dimensions (see \shp) and 
pixels are used for some bitmap and metafile dimensions. EMUs are accurate for inches, 
millimeters, points, and twips. The most commonly used units in RTF are twips. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Introduction

Control Symbol 
A control symbol consists of a backslash followed by a single, non-alphabetical character. For 
example, \~ (backslash tilde) represents a non-breaking space. Control symbols do not have 
delimiters, i.e., a space following a control symbol is treated as text, not a delimiter. 
Group 
A group can consist of text, control words, or control symbols enclosed in braces ({ }). The 
opening brace ({ ) indicates the start of the group and the closing brace ( }) indicates the end 
of the group. Each group specifies the text affected by the group and the different attributes of 
that text. The RTF file can also include groups for fonts, styles, screen color, pictures, footnotes, 
comments (annotations), headers and footers, summary information, fields, bookmarks, 
document-, section-, paragraph- and character-formatting properties, mathematics, images, 
and objects. If the font, file, style, color, revision mark, and summary-information groups and 
document-formatting properties are included in the file, they must appear in the RTF header, 
which precedes the RTF body. If the content of any group is not used, the group can be omitted. 
The groups are discussed in the following sections. Any group that uses the properties defined in 
another group must appear after the group that defines those properties. For example, color and 
font properties must precede the style group. 
Destinations 
Certain control words, referred to as destinations, mark the beginning of a collection of related 
text that could appear at another position, or destination, within the document. Destinations 
may also include text that is used but does not appear within the document at all. An example 
of a destination is the \footnote group, where the footnote text follows the control word. Page 
breaks cannot occur in destination text. A destination control word and its associated text must 
be enclosed in braces.  
Destinations added after the 1987 RTF Specification may be preceded by the control symbol \* 
(backslash asterisk). This control symbol identifies destinations whose related text should be 
ignored if the RTF reader does not recognize the destination control word. RTF writers should 
follow the convention of using this control symbol when adding new destinations or groups. 
Destinations whose related text should be inserted into the document even if the RTF reader 
does not recognize the destination should not use \*. 
Most formatting specified within a group affects only the text within that group (including nested 
groups within that group). Generally, text within a group inherits the formatting of the text in 
the outer group. However, Microsoft implementations of RTF assume that the footnote, 
annotation, header, and footer groups (described later in this specification) do not inherit the 
formatting of the outer group. Therefore, to ensure that these groups are formatted correctly, 
you should set the formatting within these groups to the appropriate default with the \sectd, 
\pard, and \plain control words, and then add any desired formatting. 
The control words, control symbols, and braces constitute control information. All other 
characters in the file are plain text or data. Here is an example containing plain text that does 
not exist within an inside group: 
{\rtf1\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\froman Tms Rmn;}{\f1\fdecor Symbol;}{\f2\fswiss Helv;}} 
{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0;\red25
5\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;} 
{\stylesheet{\fs20 \snext0 Normal;}}{\info{\author John Doe}{\creatim\yr1990\mo7\dy30\hr10\min48} 
{\version1}{\edmins0}{\nofpages1}{\nofwords0}{\nofchars0}{\vern8351}} 
\widoctrl\ftnbj \sectd\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain \fs20 This is plain text.\par} Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Introduction 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 10 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
Even though “This is plain text.” is not part of an inside group, it is part of the encompassing 
{\rtf1...} group and hence is part of the body of the RTF file. It is subject to the formatting 
specified by and after the \pard command. Specifically, the \pard resets any previous 
paragraph formatting, \plain resets any previous character formatting, and \fs20 sets the font 
size to 20 half points, i.e., 10 points. 
As previously mentioned, the backslash (\) and braces ({ }) have special meaning in RTF. To 
use these characters as text, precede them with a backslash, as in the control symbols \\, \{, 
and \}. 
Conventions of an RTF Reader 
The reader of an RTF stream is concerned with the following: 
 Separating control information from plain text. 
 Acting on control information. 
 Collecting and properly inserting text into the document, as directed by the current group state. 
Acting on control information is designed to be a relatively simple process. Some control 
information adds special characters to the plain text stream. Other information serves to change 
the program state, which includes properties of the document as a whole, or to change any of a 
collection of group states, which apply to parts of the document. 
A group state can specify the following: 
 The destination, or part of the document that the plain text is constructing. 
 Character-formatting properties, such as bold or italic. 
 Paragraph-formatting properties, such as justified or centered. 
 Section-formatting properties, such as the number of columns. 
 Table-formatting properties, which define the number of cells and dimensions of a table row. 
In practice, an RTF reader will evaluate each character it reads in sequence as follows: 
 If the character is an opening brace ({), the reader stores its current state on the stack. If the character 
is a closing brace (}) the reader retrieves the current state from the stack. 
 If the character is a backslash (\) the reader collects the control word or control symbol and its 
parameter, if any, and looks up the control word or control symbol in a table that maps control words to 
actions. It then carries out the action prescribed in the lookup table. (The possible actions are discussed 
in the following table.) The read pointer is left before or after a control-word delimiter, as appropriate. 
 If the character is anything other than an opening brace ({), closing brace (}) backslash (\) or a CRLF 
(carriage return/line feed)the reader assumes that the character is plain text and writes the character 
to the current destination using the current formatting properties. 
If the RTF reader cannot find a particular control word or control symbol in the lookup table 
described in the preceding list, the control word or control symbol should be ignored. If the 
control word or control symbol is preceded by an opening brace ({), it is part of a group. The 
current state should be saved on the stack, but no state change should occur. When a closing 
brace (}) is encountered, the current state should be retrieved from the stack, thereby resetting 
the current state. If an unknown control word is preceded by '{\*', then it starts an ignorable 
destination group. The RTF reader should discard all text up to and including the closing brace 
(}) that closes this group. All RTF readers must recognize all destinations defined in the 1987 
RTF Specification. The reader may skip past the whole ignorable destination group, but it is not 
allowed to discard the leading control word alone. Ignorable destinations defined since the 1987 
RTF Specification are marked with the \* control symbol, unless they always appear within 
groups so marked. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Introduction 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 11 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
Note: All RTF readers must implement the \* control symbol so that they can read RTF files written by newer RTF 
writers. 
For control words or control symbols that the RTF reader can find in the lookup table, the 
possible actions are as follows. 
Action Description 
Change Destination The RTF reader changes the destination to the destination described in the table entry. 
Destination changes are legal only immediately after an opening brace ({). (Other 
restrictions may also apply; for example, footnotes cannot be nested.) Many destination 
changes imply that the current property settings will be reset to their default settings. 
Examples of control words that change destination are \footnote, \header, \footer, 
\pict, \info, \fonttbl, \stylesheet, and \colortbl. This specification identifies all 
destination control words where they appear in control-word tables. 
Change Formatting Property The RTF reader changes the property as described in a table entry. If a parameter is 
required, an N appears at the end of the control word name. Appendix B: Index of RTF 
Control Words at the end of this Specification also specifies which control words require 
parameters. If a parameter is needed and not specified, then a default value is used. The 
default value used depends on the control word. If the control word does not specify a 
default, then RTF readers should assume a default of 0 except for the toggle control 
words (like \b) which have a default of 1. 
Insert Special Character The reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table 
entry. 
Insert Special Character and 
Perform Action 
The reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table 
entry. Then the reader performs the action the entry specifies. For example, when 
Microsoft Word interprets \par, a paragraph mark is inserted in the document and 
special code is run to record the paragraph properties belonging to that paragraph mark. 
Formal Syntax 
RTF uses the following syntax, based on Backus-Naur Form. 
Syntax Meaning 
#PCDATA Text (without control words) 
#SDATA Hexadecimal data 
#BDATA Binary data 
'c' A literal, where c is one or more ASCII characters 
A? Item A is optional 
A+ One or more repetitions of item A 
A* Zero or more repetitions of item A 
A B Item A followed by item B 
A | B Item A or item B 
A & B Item A or item B, in any order 
<letter> a..z | A..Z 
<control name> <letter>+ 
<digit> 0..9 
<parameter> '-'? <digit>+ 
<control word entity> '\' <control name><parameter>? 
For the sake of readability, when a <control word entity> appears in a definition, it is displayed 
in boldface without enclosing apostrophes.

Contents of an RTF File 
An RTF file has the following syntax: 
<File> '{' <header> <document> '}' 
This syntax is the standard RTF syntax; any RTF reader must be able to interpret RTF written to 
this syntax correctly. It is worth mentioning again that RTF readers are not required to interpret 
all control words, but they must be able to harmlessly ignore unknown (or unused) control 
words, and they must be able to skip over destinations marked with the \* control symbol. 
There may be RTF writers that generate RTF that does not conform to this syntax, and as such, 
RTF readers should be robust enough to handle some minor variations. Nonetheless, if an RTF 
writer generates RTF conforming to this specification, then any correct RTF reader should be 
able to interpret it. 
Note: RTF readers can reject input if strongly illegal data is encountered that is most probably created maliciously. 
For example, if the table cell width control word \cellxN is encountered outside of a table, the RTF reader should 
probably reject the file. 
Header 
The header has the following syntax: 
<header> \rtf1 \fbidis? <character set> <from>? <deffont> <deflang> <fonttbl>? <filetbl>? 
<colortbl>? <stylesheet>? <stylerestrictions>? <listtables>? <revtbl>? <rsidtable>? 
<mathprops>? <generator>? 
Each of the various header tables should appear, if they exist, in this order. Document 
properties can occur before and between the header tables. A property must be defined before 
being referenced. Specifically, 
 The style sheet must occur before any style usage. 
 The font table must precede any reference to a font (except those in <deffont>). 
 The default font keyword(s) must precede any text not explicitly formatted by a font, because they 
specify the fonts to use in such cases. 
RTF Version 
An entire RTF file is considered a group and must be enclosed in braces. The \rtfN control word 
must follow the opening brace. The numeric parameter N identifies the major version of the RTF 
Specification used. The RTF standard described in this specification, although titled as version 
1.9.1, continues to correspond syntactically to RTF Specification version 1. Therefore, the 
numeric parameter N for the \rtfN control word should still be emitted as 1. 
Character Set 
After specifying the RTF version, you must declare the default character set used in the 
document unless it is \ansi (the default). The control word for the character set must precede 
any plain text or any table control words. The RTF Specification supports the following document 
character sets <character set> 
<character set>  (\ansi | \mac | \pc | \pca)? \ansicpgN?

Windows) The reader can use the same ANSI code page to convert ANSI text back to Unicode. If 
it appears, this keyword should be emitted in the RTF header section right after the \ansi,

Note that runs of text marked with a particular font index (see \fN in the Font Table section) 
use the codepage for that font as given by \cpgN or implied by \fcharsetN, unless they use 
Unicode RTF described in the following section.  
Unicode RTF 
From Word 97 onward, Word is based on Unicode. Text characters can be handled using the 16-
bit Unicode character-encoding scheme defined in this section. Expressing this text in RTF 
required a new mechanism, because until Word 97, RTF handled only 7-bit characters directly 
and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal using \'xx. The Unicode mechanism described here 
can be applied to any RTF destination or body text. 
Control word Meaning 
\ucN This keyword represents the number (count) of bytes that follow a \uN Unicode character to give 
the codepage code that best corresponds to the Unicode character. This keyword may be used at 
any time, and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a \ucN keyword applies only 
to text following the keyword, and within the same (or deeper)nested braces. On exiting the 
group, the previous \ucN value is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and 
use the most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it encounters a \uN 
keyword. When leaving an RTF group that specified a \ucN value, the reader must revert to the 
previous value. A default of 1 should be assumed if no \ucN keyword has been seen in the 
current or outer scopes. 
A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode characters within a Unicode 
destination context (that is, inside a \ud destination) Typically, the destination will contain a 
\uc0 control sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the \ud destination, 
because the scoping rules will ensure the previous value is restored. 
\uN  This keyword represents a single Unicode character that has no equivalent ANSI representation 
based on the current ANSI code page. N represents the Unicode character value expressed as a 
decimal number. 
This keyword is followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI representation. In this 
way, old readers will ignore the \uN keyword and pick up the ANSI representation properly. 
When this keyword is encountered, the reader should ignore the next N' characters, where N' 
corresponds to the last \ucN' value encountered. 
As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present (before the ANSI 
characters)that is not counted in the characters to skip. While this is not likely to occur (or 
recommended)a \binN keyword, its argument, and the binary data that follows are considered 
one character for skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character (that is, an opening or 
closing brace) is encountered while scanning skippable data, the skippable data is considered to 
end before the delimiter. This makes it possible for a reader to perform some rudimentary error 
recovery. To include an RTF delimiter in skippable data, it must be represented using the 
appropriate control symbol (that is, escaped with a backslash,)as in plain text. Any RTF control 
word or symbol is considered a single character for the purposes of counting skippable Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Header

Control word Meaning 
characters. 
An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no corresponding ANSI character, 
should output \uN followed by the best ANSI representation it can manage. Often a question 
mark is used if no reasonable ANSI character exists. In addition, if the Unicode character 
translates into an ANSI character stream with a count of bytes differing from the current Unicode 
Character Byte Count, it should emit the appropriate \ucN keyword prior to the \uN keyword to 
notify the reader of the change. 
Most RTF control words accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. For these control words, 
Unicode values greater than 32767 are expressed as negative numbers. For example, the 
character code U+F020 is given by \u-4064. To get -4064, convert F02016 to decimal (61472)
and subtract 65536. 
Occasionally Word writes SYMBOL_CHARSET (nonUnicode) characters in the range 
U+F020..U+F0FF instead of U+0020..U+00FF. Internally Word uses the values U+F020..U+F0FF 
for these characters so that plain-text searches don’t mistakenly match SYMBOL_CHARSET 
characters when searching for rnicode characters in the range rHMMOMKKrHMMccK qo find out the 
correct symbol font to useI eKgKI tingdingsI pymbolI etcKI find the last pvj_li_CeAopbq font 
control word \fN used, look up font N in the font table and find the face name. The charset is 
specified by the \fcharsetN control word and SYMBOL_CHARSET is for N = 2. This corresponds 
to codepage 42. 
\upr This keyword represents a destination with two embedded destinations, one represented using 
Unicode and the other using ANSI. This keyword operates in conjunction with the \ud keyword to 
provide backward compatibility. The general syntax is as follows: 
'{' \upr '{' keyword ansi_text '}{\*' \ud '{' keyword Unicode_text '}}}' 
Notice that the \upr keyword destination does not use the \* keyword; this forces the old RTF 
readers to pick up the ANSI representation and discard the Unicode one. 
\ud This destination is represented in Unicode. The text is represented using a mixture of ANSI 
translation and \uN keywords to represent characters that do not have exact ANSI equivalents.  
Document Text 
Document text should be emitted as ANSI characters. If there are Unicode characters that do 
not have corresponding ANSI characters, they should be output using the \ucN and \uN 
keywords. 
For example, the text “LabValue” (Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 
0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows (assuming a 
previous \uc1): 
Lab\u915GValue 
Destination Text 
Destination text is defined as any text represented in an RTF destination. A good example is the 
bookmark name in the \bkmkstart destination. 
Any destination containing Unicode characters can be written as a pair of destinations, one 
within a \upr group that ensures old readers can read it properly and the other within a \ud 
group that ensures no Unicode character encoding is lost when read with a new reader. 
For example, a bookmark name “LabValue” (Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 
0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows 
(assuming an active \uc1): 
{\upr{\*\bkmkstart LabGValue}{\*\ud{\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915GValue}}} Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Header

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
The first sub destination contains only ANSI characters and is the representation that old 
readers will see. The second sub destination is a \*\ud destination that contains a second copy 
of the \bkmkstart destination. This copy can contain Unicode characters and is the 
representation that Unicode-aware readers must pay attention to, ignoring the ANSI-only 
version. 
Note: this example could also be expressed as (assuming an active \uc1) 
{\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915GValue} 
 
Default Fonts and Languages 
Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as 
defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable 
Japanese formatting options. Here N refers to an entry in the font table. The syntax for <from>, 
<deffont> and <deflang> appearing in the RTF Header is 
<from> \fromtext | \fromhtml 
<deffont> \deffN? \adeffN? (\stshfdbchN  \stshflochN  \stshfhichN  \stshfbiN)? 
<deflang> \deflangN? \deflangfeN? \adeflangN? 
 
Control word Meaning 
\fromtext Indicates document was originally plain text email.  
\fromhtmlN Indicates document was originally HTML email and may contain encapsulated HTML tags. This 
keyword may be followed by a version number (currently 1) 
\deffN Defines default font to be \fN in case text is encountered before any \fN control word is 
active. 
\adeffN Defines default BiDi font to be \fN in case BiDi text is encountered before any \fN control 
word is active. 
\stshfdbchN Defines default East Asian font for style sheets. 
\stshflochN Defines default ASCII font for style sheets. 
\stshfhichN Defines default High-ANSI font for style sheets.  
\stshfbiN Defines default Complex Script (BiDi) font for style sheets.  
\deflangN Defines default language to be used when the \plain control word is encountered. See the 
standard language table  for a list of possible values for N. 
\deflangfeN Default language ID for East Asian text in Word. 
\adeflangN Default language ID for South Asian/Middle Eastern text in Word. The default languages are 
determined by the current primary editing language and the enabled editing languages (can 
be changed via Microsoft Office Language Settings applet)  
Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as 
defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable 
Japanese formatting options. N refers to an entry in the font table. 
Theme Data  
A document’s Theme Data contains a hex-encoded representation of a set of styling that can be 
applied to objects within a document and which affects the look of the document and the 
information and objects it contains. For example, in a Word 2007 document, shapes can have a Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Header

certain look, text can have certain properties, and headings may be styled, by a single Theme. 
When a Theme is changed, not only may the font and colors change, but also the effects applied 
to the shapes and tables within the document. 
Theme Data has the following syntax: 
<themedata> '{\*' \themedata #SDATA '}' 
 
The following control word can be used in this destination: 
Control word Meaning 
\*\themedata  Starts destination containing a hexadecimal representation of the document theme. 
 
Color Scheme Mapping 
Color Scheme Mapping enables multiple Theme colors to be chained together. Color Scheme 
Mapping has the following syntax: 
<colorschememapping>  '{\*' \colorschememapping #SDATA '}' 
The following control word can be used in this destination: 
Control word Meaning 
\*\colorschememapping  Starts destination containing a hexadecimal representation of the document Color Scheme

Font Table 
The \fonttbl control word introduces the font table group. Unique \fN control words define 
each font available in the document. These control words refer to that font throughout the 
document. The font table group has the following syntax. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Font and Color Tables

Note: For <fontemb>, either <fontfname> or <data> must be present, although both may be present. 
Note: When <themefont> is present, related font information such as the font name, PANOSE information is still 
provided so that theme-unaware applications can read what the given font evaluates to while safely ignoring the 
theme control words new to Word 2007. Only \fcharsetN and \cpgN provide any additional information to the 
entry that is not already contained in <themefont>. 
 
All fonts available to the RTF writer can be included in the font table, even if the document does 
not use all the fonts. 
RTF also supports font families so that applications can attempt to intelligently choose fonts if 
the exact font is not present on the reading system. RTF uses the following control words to 
describe the various font families. 
Control word Font family Examples 
\fnil Unknown or default fonts (the default) Not applicable 
\froman Roman, proportionally spaced serif fonts Times New Roman, Palatino 
\fswiss Swiss, proportionally spaced sans serif fonts Arial 
\fmodern Fixed-pitch serif and sans serif fonts Courier New, Pica 
\fscript Script fonts Cursive 
\fdecor Decorative fonts Old English, ITC Zapf Chancery 
\ftech Non Unicode, technical and symbol fonts Symbol, Wingdings 
\fbidi Arabic, Hebrew, or other bidirectional font Miriam  
If an RTF file uses a default font, the default font number is specified with the \deffN control 
word, which must precede the font-table group. The RTF writer supplies the default font number 
used in the creation of the document as the numeric argument N. The RTF reader then 
translates this number through the font table into the most similar font available from the 
reader’s operating system. 
The following control words specify the font character set, alternative font name, pitch of a font 
in the font table, and non-tagged font name.

Control word Meaning 
\fprqN  Specifies the pitch of a font in the font table. 
Pitch N 
Default pitch 0 
Fixed pitch 1 
Variable pitch 2 
 
\*\panose Destination keyword. This destination contains a 10-byte Panose 1 number. Each byte represents 
a single font property as described by the Panose 1 standard specification. 
\*\fname Optional font-table control word that defines the nontagged font name, that is, the name without 
the tag that identifies the character set being used. For example, Arial is a nontagged font name, 
and Arial (Cyrillic) is a tagged font name. This control word is used by WordPad. Word ignores 
this control word (and never creates it) 
\fbiasN Used to arbitrate between two fonts when a particular character can exist in either a non-East 
Asian or an East Asian font. Word 97 through Word 2007 emit the \fbiasN keyword only in the 
context of bullets or list information (that is, a \listlevel destination). The default value of 0 for 
N indicates a non-East Asian font. A value of 1 indicates an East Asian font. Additional values 
may be defined in future releases. 
\fcharsetN  Specifies the character set of a font in the font table. If this appears, it implies that bytes in runs 
tagged with the associated \fN are character codes in the codepage corresponding to the charset 
N. Use this codepage to convert the codes to Unicode using a function like the Windows 
MultiByteToWideChar()See also the \cpgN control word, which, if it appears, supersedes the 
codepage given by \fcharsetN. Values for N are defined, for example, in the Windows header 
file wingdi.h (e.g., see ANSI_CHARSET) and are repeated here together with the corresponding 
Windows or Mac codepages for convenience:

Font Embedding 
RTF supports embedded fonts with the \fontemb group located inside a font definition. An 
embedded font can be specified by a file name, or the actual font data may be located inside the 
group. If a file name is specified, it is contained in the \fontfile group. The \cpgN control word 
can be used to specify the character set for the file name. 
RTF supports TrueType and other embedded fonts. The type of the embedded font is described 
by the following control words. 
Control word Embedded font type 
\ftnil Unknown or default font type (the default) 
\fttruetype TrueType font  
Code Page Support 
A font may have a different character set from the character set of the document. For example, 
the Symbol font has the same characters in the same code positions both on the Macintosh and 
in Windows. Typically, RTF fonts use the code page corresponding to the \fcharsetN control 
word in their \fonttbl description. If the charset doesn’t exist, the codepage may be given by 
the \cpgN control word, for which the code page is N. If the \cpgN does appear, it supersedes 
the code page corresponding to the \fcharsetN. For such cases, codepage conversions can be 
avoided altogether by using the Unicode \uN notation for characters. In addition, file names 
(used in field instructions and in embedded fonts) may not necessarily be the same as the 
character set of the document; the \cpgN control word can change the character set for these 
file names as well. However, all RTF documents must still declare a character set (that is, \ansi, 
\mac, \pc, or \pca) to maintain backward compatibility with earlier RTF readers. 
The valid values for \cpgN are given in the \ansicpgN table. 
Theme Font Information 
The following control words may be emitted along with a particular font entry in the RTF font table 
and specify the entry’s relation to the document’s theme. 
Note: When one of these control words is present, related font information such as the font name, PANOSE 
information is still provided so that theme-unaware applications can read what the given font evaluates to while 
safely ignoring the theme control words new to Microsoft Office Word 2007. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Font and Color Tables

File Table 
The \filetbl control word introduces the file table destination. The only time a file table is 
created in RTF is when the document contains subdocuments. The file table group defines the 
files referenced in the document and has the following syntax: 
<filetbl>  '{\*' \filetbl ('{' <fileinfo> '}') '}' 
<fileinfo> \file \fidN \frelativeN? \fosnumN? <filesource>+ <file name> 
<filesource> \fvalidmac | \fvaliddos | \fvalidntfs | \fvalidhpfs | \fnetwork | \fnonfilesys 
<file name> #PCDATA  
Note: The file name can be any valid alphanumeric string for the named file system, indicating the complete path 
and file name. 
Control word Meaning 
\filetbl A list of documents referenced by the current document. The file table has a structure analogous 
to the style or font table. This is a destination control word that is output as part of the document 
header. 
\file Marks the beginning of a file group, which lists relevant information about the referenced file. 
This is a destination control word. 
\fidN File ID number. Files are referenced later in the document using this number. 
\frelativeN The character position within the path (starting at 0) where the referenced file's path starts to be 
relative to the path of the owning document. For example, if a document is saved to the path 
C:\Private\Resume\File1.doc and its file table contains the path 
C:\Private\Resume\Edu\File2.doc, then that entry in the file table will be \frelative18, to point 
at the character "E" in "Edu". This allows preservation of relative paths. 
\fosnumN Currently only filled in for paths from the Macintosh file system. It is an operating system–
specific number for identifying the fileI which may be used to speed up access to the file or find 
the file if it was moved to another folder or diskK qhe jacintosh operating system name for this 
number is the ?file idK? Additional meanings of the \fosnumN control word may be defined for 
other file systems in the future. 
\fvalidmac Macintosh file system. 
\fvaliddos MS-DOS file system. 
\fvalidntfs NTFS file system. 
\fvalidhpfs HPFS file system. 
\fnetwork Network file system. This control word may be used in conjunction with any of the previous file 
source control words.

Color Table 
The \colortbl control word introduces the color table group, which defines screen colors, 
character colors, and other color information. The color table group has the following syntax: 
<colortbl> '{' \colortbl <colordef>+ '}' 
<colordef> <themecolor>? & \ctintN? & \cshadeN? \redN? & \greenN? & \blueN? ';' 
<themecolor> \cmaindarkone | \cmainlightone | \cmaindarktwo | \cmainlighttwo | 
\caccentone | \caccenttwo | \caccentthree | \caccentfour | \caccentfive | 
\caccentsix | \chyperlink | \cfollowedhyperlink | \cbackgroundone |  
\ctextone | \cbackgroundtwo | \ctexttwo  
Note: When <themecolor> is used, the red/green/blue values are still provided so that theme-unaware 
applications can read what the given color evaluates to while safely ignoring the theme control words 
introduced by Word 2007. 
For example, consider the following sample RTF code of a color table group: 
{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0; 
\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255; 
\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128; 
\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192; 
\caccentone\ctint255\cshade191\red174\green150\blue56;} 
 
The following are valid control words for this group. For the <themecolor> control words, a 
\ctintN and \cshadeN can be specified if the color entry describes a tint or a shade of the 
theme color. 
Control word Meaning 
\colortbl Destination for color table definitions 
\redN Red intensity, such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 255, i.e., 8 bits per RGB color component 
\greenN Green intensity, such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 255. 
\blueN Blue intensity, such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 255. 
\ctintN Specifies the tint of the given theme when specifying a theme color. If the entry references a 
theme color, \ctintN specifies its shade. If not, \ctintN is ignored.  
Here 0 ≤ N ≤ 255, where 255 means no tint, and 0 means full tint (resulting in white color). If 
this control word is not specified, a value of 255 is implied.  
Note: If the parameter of this control word is less than 255, the parameter of the \cshade control 
word must be equal to 255. A tint or a shade may be specified, but not both. 
\cshadeN Specifies the shade of the given theme when specifying a theme color. If the entry references a 
theme color, \cshadeN specifies its shade. If not, \cshadeN is ignored.  
Here 0 ≤ N ≤ 255, where 255 means no shade, and 0 means full shade (resulting in black color) 
If this control word is not specified, a value of 255 is implied.  
Note: If the parameter of this control word is less than 255, the parameter of the \ctintN 
control word must be equal to 255. A tint or a shade may be specified, but not both. 
\cmaindarkone Color entry references “Main Dark 1” theme color.  
\cmainlightone Color entry references “Main Light 1” theme color.  
\cmaindarktwo  Color entry references “Main Dark 2” theme color 
\cmainlighttwo  Color entry references “Main Light 2” theme color.  
\caccentone  Color entry references “Accent 1” theme color.  
\caccenttwo  Color entry references “Accent 2” theme color Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Font and Color Tables

Control word Meaning 
\caccentthree Color entry references “Accent 3” theme color.  
ycaccentfour Color entry references “Accent 4” theme color.  
ycaccentfive Color entry references “Accent 5” theme color.  
ycaccentsix Color entry references “Accent 6” theme color 
ychyperlink Color entry references “Hyperlink” theme color 
ycfollowedhyperlink Color entry references “Followed Hyperlink” theme color.  
ycbackgroundone Color entry references “Background 1” theme colorK  
yctextone Color entry references “Text 1” theme color.  
ycbackgroundtwo Color entry references “Background 2” theme color.  
yctexttwo Color entry references “Text 2” theme color.   
Each definition must be delimited by a semicolon, even if the definition is omitted. If a color 
definition is omitted, the RTF reader uses its default color. The following example defines the 
default color table used by Word. The first color is omitted, as shown by the semicolon following 
the \colortbl control word. The missing definition indicates that color 0 is the “auto” color. 
{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0; 
\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255; 
\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128; 
\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;} 
The foreground and background colors use indexes into the color table to define a color. The 
following example defines a block of text in color (where supported). Note that the \cfN or 
\cbN index (color foreground or color background) is the index of an entry in the color table, 
which represents a red/green/blue (RGB) color combination. 
{\f1\cb1\cf2 This is colored text. The background is color 1 and the foreground is color 2.} 
If the file is read by software that does not display color, the reader should ignore the color 
table group.  
Note: Windows versions of Word have never supported \cbN, but it can be emulated by the control word 
sequence \chshdng0\chcbpatN. 
Default Properties 
The following control words correspond to the default properties for the given RTF document.  
Control word Meaning 
\*\defchp Specifies default character level properties (see Font (Character)Formatting Properties) 
\*\defpap Specifies default paragraph level properties (see Paragraph Formatting Properties) 
 
For example, the following RTF fragment specifyies the default paragraph level properties for a 
given RTF file: 
{\*\defpap\ql\li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0}

Style Sheet 
The \stylesheet control word introduces the style sheet group, which contains definitions and 
descriptions of the various styles used in the document. All styles in the document's style sheet 
can be included, even if not all the styles are used. In RTF, a style is a form of shorthand used 
to specify a set of character, paragraph, or section formatting. 
The style sheet group has the following syntax: 
<stylesheet>  '{' \stylesheet <style>+ '}' 
<style> '{' <styledef>? <keycode>? <formatting> \additive? \sbasedonN? \snextN? \sautoupd? 
\slinkN? \sqformat? \spriorityN? \sunhideusedN? \slocked? \shidden? \ssemihiddenN? 
\spersonal? \scompose? \sreply? \styrsidN? <stylename>? ';}' 
<styledef> \sN | \*\csN | \*\dsN | \*\tsN \tsrowd 
<keycode> '{' \keycode <keys> '}' 
<keys> (\shift? & \ctrl? & \alt?) <key> 
<key> \fnN | #PCDATA 
<formatting> (<brdrdef> | <parfmt> | <apoctl> | <tabdef> | <shading> | <chrfmt>) 
<stylename> #PCDATA  
For <style>, both <styledef> and <stylename> are optional; the default is paragraph style 0. 
Note for <stylename> Microsoft Word for the Macintosh interprets commas in #PCDATA as 
separating style synonyms. In addition, for <key>, the data must be exactly one character. 
Control word Meaning 
\sN Designates paragraph style with the style handle N, which can be any 16-bit integer. 
\*\csN Designates character style with a style handle N. Like \sN, \csN is not a destination control word. 
However, it is important to treat it like one inside the style sheet; that is, \csN must be prefixed 
with \* and must appear as the first item inside a group. Doing so ensures that readers that do not 
understand character styles will skip the character style information correctly. When used in body 
text to indicate that a character style was applied, do not include the \* prefix.  
\*\dsN Designates section style with style handle N. 
\*\tsN Designates table style, in the same style as \csN for placement and prefixes. 
\tsrowd Like \trowd but for table style definitions. 
\additive Used in a character style definition ('{\*' \csN…'}') Indicates that character style attributes are to 
be added to the current paragraph style attributes, rather than setting the paragraph attributes to 
only those defined in the character style definition. 
\sbasedonN Defines the style handle of the style the current style is based on (default is 222—no style) 
\snextN Defines the style to be used in the next paragraph after the paragraph marked by this style. If it is 
omitted, the next style is the current style. 
\sautoupd Automatically update styles. 
\shidden Style does not appear in the Styles drop-down list in the Style dialog box1 (on the Format menu, 
click Styles) 
\slinkN The style is linked to the style whose style sheet index is denoted by N. A paragraph style is linked 
to a character style when they share the same font properties and the character style is updated 
when the paragraph style changes. Normally Word will suppress the display of the linked character 
style in most style lists. 
\slocked The style is locked. It cannot be used in the current document if protection is on. 
\spersonal Style is a personal e-mail style.

Control word Meaning 
\scompose Style is the e-mail compose style. 
\sreply Style is the e-mail reply style. 
\styrsidN Tied to the rsid table, N is the rsid of the author who implemented the style. 
\ssemihiddenN N nonzero or N missing: style does not appear in drop-down menus. If control word is missing or N 
= 0, style may appear in drop-down menus. 
\keycode This group is specified within the description of a style in the style sheet in the RTF header. The 
syntax for this group is '{\*' \keycode <keys> '}' where <keys> are the characters used in the 
key code. For example, a style, Normal, may be defined {\s0 {\*\keycode \shift\ctrl n}Normal;} 
within the RTF style sheet. See the Special Character control words for the characters outside the 
alphanumeric range that may be used. 
\alt The ALT modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles. 
\shift The SHIFT modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles. 
\ctrl The CTRL modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles. 
\fnN Specifies a function key where N is the function key number. Used to describe shortcut-key codes 
for styles. 
\sqformat  This control word specifies whether this style shall be treated as a primary style when this 
document is loaded by an application. If this control word is present, then this style has been 
designated as being particularly important for the current document, and this information may be 
used by an application in any means desired.  
Note: This setting does not imply any behavior for the style, only that the style is of particular 
significance for this document. 
If this element is omitted, then the style shall not be considered a primary style for this document. 
\spriorityN This control word specifies a number that may be used to sort the set of style definitions in a user 
interface when this document is loaded by an application and the recommended setting is specified 
in the \stylesortmethodN control word.  
If N = 1, then this priority shall be used to sort all available styles in ascending value order. 
If this control word is omitted, then the style shall not have an associated priority value and shall 
be sorted to the end of the list of style definitions (equivalent to a priority value of infinity)when 
the recommended sort order setting is specified. 
\sunhideusedN  This control word specifies whether this style shall be hidden from the main user interface until it is 
used.  
If N = 1, then this style may be used to format content (that is any content which references this 
style shall have its properties as normal) but the style shall be hidden from the main user interface 
associated with that application. 
Note: The interpretation of a "main" user interface shall not be dictated by this spec, and may be 
defined by an application as appropriate. This setting is intended to define a style property that 
allows styles to be seen and modified in an advanced user interface, without exposing the style in a 
less advanced setting. For example, the style that is used to format the contents of a comment 
should typically not be shown in a simple user interface, as it is uncommon to want to modify it. 
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, then the style shall not be required to be hidden from the 
main user interface.  
The following is an example of an RTF style sheet: 
{\stylesheet{\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

An example of the usage of these styles in an RTF paragraph: 
\pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel0\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 
\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {This is the Normal Style 
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\par 
}\pard\plain \s16\qc \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel0\adjustright 
\rin0\lin0\itap0 \b\fs24\cf2\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033  
{This is a centered paragraph with blue, bold font. I call the style CENTER.\par } 
\pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 
\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\par The word \'93}{\cs15\b\ul\cf6 
style}{\'94 is red and underlined. I used a style I called UNDERLINE.\par } 
 
Some of the control words used in this example are discussed in later sections. Note that the 
properties of the style were emitted following the application of the style. This was done for two 
reasons: (1) to allow RTF readers that do not support styles to continue to display formatting 
correctly; and (2) to reveal the additive model for styles, where additional property changes are 
“added” on top of the defined style. Some RTF readers may not “apply” a style when only the 
style number is used, unless the accompanying formatting information is provided as well. 
Quick Styles 
Quick Styles are a set of styles that should be readily available for a user via the hosting 
application’s user interface. The \noqfpromote control word specifies that a hosting application 
should not automatically display the following styles as Quick Styles. 
Book Title Caption Emphasis Heading1 
Heading2 Heading3 Heading4 Heading5 
Heading6 Heading7 Heading8 Heading9 
Intense Emphasis Intense Quote Intense Reference List Paragraph  
No Spacing Normal Quote Strong 
Subtitle Subtle Emphasis Subtle Reference Table of Contents Heading 
Title    
Note: This control word is usually used in conjunction with \sqformat to customize the list of 
Quick Styles displayed by a hosting application when it loads an RTF file.  
 
Table Styles 
Word 2002 introduced table styles. Table styles are like other styles in that they contain 
properties to be shared by many tables. Unlike the other styles though, table styles allow for 
conditional formatting, such as specifically coloring the first row. 
To address the issue of older readers opening newer RTF files, raw properties were 
implemented. Older readers can still see the regular properties and edit them, but newer Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Style Sheets 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 27 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
readers should be able to read the RTF back in and not lose any style functionality. This leaves 
two types of properties: those applied by older writers that are readable by older readers, and 
those the user applied directly to override aspects of the style. The user-applied changes are 
referred to as “raw” and have a higher priority than their non-raw counterparts have.  
The following table describes keywords available for style definitions. Any older table formatting 
properties may be used as well.

List Tables 
Word 97, Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 store bullets and numbering 
information very differently from earlier versions of Word. In Word 6.0, for example, number-
formatting data is stored individually with each paragraph. In Word 97 and later versions, 
however, all of the formatting information is stored in a pair of document-wide list tables that 
act as a style sheet, and each individual paragraph stores only an index to one of the tables, like 
a style index. 
There are two list tables in Word: the List table (destination \listtable), and the List Override 
table (destination \listoverridetable). 
List Table 
The first table Word stores is the List table. A List table is a list of lists (destination \list). Each 
list contains a number of list properties that pertain to the entire list, and a list of levels 
(destination \listlevel), each of which contains properties that pertain only to that level. The 
\listpicture destination contains all the picture bullets used in the document, with a \shppict 
headed list of \pict entries. These are referenced within the list by the \levelpictureN 
keyword, with N referring to an element in the list, starting at 0. 
The syntax for the List table is as follows: 
<listtable> '{\*' \listtable <listpicture>? <list>+ '}' 
<listpicture> '{\*' \listpicture <shppictlist> '}' 
<list> \list \listemplateid & (\listsimple | \listhybrid)? & <listlevel>+ & \listrestarthdn & 
\listidN & (\listname #PCDATA ';')\liststyleidN? \liststylename? 
<listlevel> '{' \listlevel <number> <justification> & \levelfollowN & \levelstartatN & \lvltentative? 
(\leveloldN & \levelprevN? & \levelprevspaceN? & \levelspaceN? & \levelindentN?)? & 
<leveltext> & <levelnumbers> & \levellegalN? & \levelnorestartN? & <chrfmt>? & 
\levelpictureN & \liN? & \fiN? & (\jclisttab \txN) & \linN? '}' 
<number> \levelnfcN | \levelnfcnN | (\levelnfcN & \levelnfcnN) 
<justification> \leveljcN | \leveljcnN | (\leveljcN & \leveljcnN) 
<leveltext> '{' \leveltext \leveltemplateid? #SDATA ';}' 
<levelnumbers> '{' \levelnumbers #SDATA ';}'  
Top-Level List Properties 
Control word Meaning 
\listidN Each list must have a unique list ID that should be randomly generated. N is a long integer. 
The list ID cannot be between –1 and –5.  
\listtemplateidN Each list should have a unique template ID as well, which also should be randomly generated. 
The template ID –1 means the template ID is undefined. N is a long integer.  
\listsimpleN 1 if the list has one level; 0 (default) if the list has nine levels. 
\listhybrid Present if the list has 9 levels, each of which is the equivalent of a simple list. Only one of 
\listsimpleN and \listhybrid should be present. Word 2000 and newer versions will write 
lists with the \listhybrid property. 
\listrestarthdnN 1 if the list restarts at each section; 0 if not. Used for Word 95 compatibility only.  
\listname The argument for \listname is a string that is the name of this list. Names allow ListNum 
fields to specify the list to which they belong. This is a destination control word. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 List Tables

Control word Meaning 
\liststyleidN This identifies the style of this list from the list style definition that has this ID as its \listidN. 
There can be more than one list style reference to a list style definition. This keyword follows 
the same numbering convention as \listidN. 
\liststyleidN and \liststylename are exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per \list 
definition, but never both. 
\liststylename Identifies this list as a list style definition. This creates a new list style with the given name and 
the properties of the current list. 
\liststyleidN and \liststylename are exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per \list 
definition, but never both. 
While Word 97 emitted simple or multilevel (not simple) lists, Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 
2003, and Word 2007 emit hybrid lists, which are essentially collections of simple lists. The main 
difference between Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 hybrid lists and Word 
97 multilevel lists is that each level of a hybrid list has a unique identifier. 
 
List Levels 
Each list consists of either one or nine list levels depending upon whether the \listsimple flag is 
set. Each list level contains a number of properties that specify the formatting for that level, 
such as the start-at value, the text string surrounding the number, its justification and indents. 
Control word Meaning 
\levelstartatN N specifies the start-at value for the level. 
\lvltentative  Specifies that a given numbering level was been saved by a producer but was not used in 
the parent document. This means that this numbering level may be redefined by a future 
consumer without changing the actual content of the document. 
If this control word is present, the RTF for a given document will contain the numbering 
level information associated with this numbering level, but the 'tentative' numbering 
level(s)shall not be represented in any of the hosting application's user interface pertaining 
to numbering levels.

Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 prefer \leveljcnN to \leveljcN if both 
are present, but it will be written for backward compatibility with older readers. 
\leveloldN 1 if this level was converted from Word 6.0 or Word 95; 0 if it is a native Word 97 through 
Word 2007 level. 
\levelprevN 1 if this level includes the text from the previous level (used for Word 95 compatibility 
only)otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword 
is emitted. 
\levelprevspaceN 1 if this level includes the indentation from the previous level (used for Word 95 
compatibility only) otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the 
\leveloldN keyword is emitted. 
\levelindentN Minimum distance from the left indent to the start of the paragraph text (used for Word 95 
compatibility only) This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN keyword is emitted. 
\levelspaceN Minimum distance from the right edge of the number to the start of the paragraph text 
(used for Word 95 compatibility only) This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN 
keyword is emitted. 
\leveltext If the list is hybrid, as indicated by \listhybrid, the \leveltemplateidN keyword will be 
included, whose argument is a unique level ID that should be randomly generated. The

Control word Meaning 
\levelnumbers The argument for this destination should be a string that gives the offsets into the 
\leveltext of the level placeholders. In the preceding example, “1.1.1.”, the 
\levelnumbers RTF should be 
{\levelnumbers \'01\'03\'05} 
because the level placeholders have indices 1, 3, and 5. This is a destination control word. 
\levelfollowN Specifies which character follows the level text:  
0 Tab 
1 Space 
2 Nothing 
\levellegalN 1 if any list numbers from previous levels should be converted to Arabic numbers;  
0 if they should be left with the format specified by their own level’s definition. 
\levelnorestartN 1 if this level does not restart its count each time a super ordinate level is incremented; 0 if 
this level does restart its count each time a super ordinate level is incremented. 
\levelpictureN Determines which picture bullet from the \listpicture destination should be applied. 
\levelpicturenosize If present, do not resize the picture bullet if the size of the \par marker is changed. 
 
In addition to all of these properties, each list level can contain any character properties (all of 
which affect all text for that level) and any combination of three paragraph properties: left 
indents, first line left indents, and tabs—each of which must be of a special type: \jclisttab. 
These paragraph properties will be automatically applied to any paragraph in the list. 
List Override Table 
The List Override table is a list of list overrides (destination \listoverride). Each list override 
contains the \listidN of one of the lists in the List table, and a list of any properties it chooses to 
override. Each paragraph will contain a list override index (keyword \lsN), which is a 1-based 
index into this table. Most list overrides do not override any properties—instead, they provide a 
level of indirection to a list. There are generally two types of list overrides: 
(1) Formatting overrides. Allows a paragraph to be part of a list and to be numbered along with 
the other members of the list, but have different formatting properties 
(2) Start-at overrides. Allows a paragraph to share the formatting properties of a list, but have 
different start-at values. The first element in the document with each list override index takes 
the start-at value that the list override specifies as its value, while each subsequent element is 
assigned the number succeeding the previous element of the list. 
List overrides have a few top-level keywords, including a \listoverridecountN, which contains a 
count of the number of levels whose format is overridden. This \listoverridecountN should 
always be either 0, 1 or 9, depending upon whether the list to be overridden is simple (0 or 1) 
or hybrid/multilevel (9). All of the actual override information is stored within a list of list 
override levels (destination \lfolevel) 
The syntax for the List Override table is as follows: 
<listoverridetable> '{\*' \listoverridetable <listoverride>+ '}' 
<listoverride> '{' \listoverride & \listidN & \listoverridecountN & \lsN <lfolevel>? '}' 
<lfolevel> '{' \lfolevel \listoverrideformatN? \listoverridestartat? <listlevel> '}'

Control word Meaning 
\listidN Should exactly match the \listid of one of the lists in the List table. The value N is a 
long integer. 
\listoverridecountN Number of list override levels within this list override (0, 1 or 9) 
\lsN The (1-based)index of this \listoverride in the \listoverride table. This value should 
never be zero inside a \listoverride and must be unique for all \listoverride’s within 
a documentK qhe valid values are from N to OMMMK qhe value M means no listK 
ylistoverridestartat fndicates an override of the start-at valueK 
ylistoverrideformatN Number of list format override levels within this list override (should be either 1, 9, or 
missing, which means 0)  
Each list override level contains flags to specify whether the formatting or start-at values are 
being overridden for each level. If the format flag (\listoverrideformatN) is given, the 
\lfolevel should also contain a list level (<listlevel>). If the start-at flag (\listoverridestartat)
is given, a start-at value must be provided. If the start-at is overridden but the format is not, 
then a \levelstartatN should be provided in the <lfolevel> itself. If both the start-at and the 
format are overridden, put the \levelstartatN inside the <listlevel> contained in the 
<lfolevel>.
 
Paragraph Group Properties 
Word 2002 introduced paragraph group properties, similar to style sheets. A document using 
paragraph group properties places a \pgptbl entry in the header. Elements in the Paragraph 
Group Properties (PGP) table are entered as they are created in the document and are identified 
with an \ipgpN value. The formatting options are taken from the regular paragraph formatting 
options. PGP table entries may exist with different \ipgpN values but with the same properties. 
Any paragraph that references an entry in the PGP table does so by emitting \ipgpN, which sets 
paragraph formatting options according to the entry in the PGP table. Additional formatting 
options may also be employed. 
The PGP syntax is as follows: 
<pgptbl> '{\*' \pgptbl <entry>+ '}' 
<entry> '{' \pgp <value> '}' 
<value> \ipgpN <parfmt>+ 
 
The following is a sample PGP table with two entries: 
{\*\pgptbl {\pgp\ipgp13\itap0\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0}{\pgp\ipgp80\itap0\li720\ri0\sb100\sa100}} 
Revision Marks 
This table allows tracking of multiple authors and reviewers of a document, and is used in 
conjunction with the character properties for tracking changes (using revision marks). Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
\*\revtbl This group consists of subgroups that each identify the author of a revision in the document, as 
in {Author1;}. This is a destination control word. 
Revision conflicts, such as those that result when one author deletes another's additions, are 
stored as one group, in the following form: 
CurrentAuthor\'00\'<length of previous author's name>PreviousAuthor\'00 
PreviousRevisionTime 
The 4 bytes of the Date/Time (DTTM)structure are emitted as ASCII characters, so values 
greater than 127 should be emitted as quoted hexadecimal values. 
 
All time references for revision marks use the following bit field structure, DTTM. 
Bit numbers Information Range 
0–5 Minute 0–59 
6–10 Hour 0–23 
11–15 Day of month 1–31 
16–19 Month 1–12 
20–28 Year = Year – 1900 
29–31 Day of week 0 (Sun)–6 (Sat) 
 
RSID 
In Word 2002, a new style of revision tracking was established. RSIDs (Revision Save IDs) 
indicate when text or a property was changed. Whenever text is added or deleted or properties 
are changed, that text or property is tagged with the current "Save ID," which is a random 
number that changes each time the document is saved. They are primarily used when merging 
or comparing two documents with a common history but no revision marks. By reviewing the 
RSID we can tell which of the two authors made the change. Without the RSID we can only tell 
that there is a difference, but we do not know if (for example) it was an addition by author A or 
a deletion by author B. An RSID table is placed after all other style definitions and before the 
<generator> and <info> groups. Changed text and properties is contained in groups with an 
appropriate control word (like \insrsidN for insertions) that identifies the editing session. 
The syntax for an RSID table is as follows: 
<rsidtable> '{\*' \rsidtbl \rsidN+ '}' 
 
Control word Meaning 
\*\rsidtbl Destination for the revision save ID table. 
\rsidN Each time a document is saved a new entry is added to this table, with N being the random 
long integer number assigned to represent the unique session. 
\insrsidN An RSID is inserted where an insertion is made to denote the session in which particular text 
was inserted. Example: if "This is text." is inserted, it will be written in RTF as  
{\insrsid8282541 This is text.}  
For use in lists:  
{\insrsid8282541 Item in List \par{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\insrsid8282541 \loch\af3\dbch\af0

\rsidrootN Designates the start of the document’s history (first save). 
ydelrsidN RSID value identifying when text was marked as deleted. 
\charrsidN RSID value identifying when character formatting was changed. 
\sectrsidN RSID identifying when section formatting was changed. 
\pararsidN RSID identifying when paragraph formatting was changed. 
\tblrsidN RSID identifying when table formatting was changed. 
 
Old Properties 
With tracking enabled, you can document changes to formatting. To keep track of the property 
before the changes were made, Old Properties were created. This tracking uses the following 
syntax: 
<oldprop> '{\*' <oldproptype> <oldproperties>+ <trackinginfo> ';}' 
<oldproptype> \oldcprops | \oldpprops | \oldtprops | \oldsprops 
<oldproperties> This section includes any of the relevant format tags that would have to be put in place to 
revert the document to its pre-edit form. For example, this would be \b0 if the user had 
chosen to make the selection bold. 
<trackinginfo> This can be any tag used to track the author, revision ID, and date. 
 
Control word Meaning 
\oldcprops Old character formatting properties. 
\oldpprops Old paragraph formatting properties. 
\oldtprops Old table formatting properties. 
\oldsprops Old section formatting properties. 
The following is an example of the correct use of the Old Properties when bold and italic are 
applied to a section of existing text. If the original text “This is a test.” is changed to “This is a 
test.”, the following code example will be formed, which would tell an RTF reader that to undo 
the change to the character property bold and italic would have to be disabled: 
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2778197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0

User Protection Information 
The following is the syntax for the user protection information group, which lists the specific 
users granted exceptions to the document protection. 
<userprotection> '{\*' \protusertbl <user>+ '}' 
<user> '{' #PCDATA '}' 
A user name is enclosed by braces.

Generator 
Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 allow the RTF emitter application to stamp the 
document with its name, version, and build number. The generator area has the following 
syntax: 
<generator> '{\*' \generator <name> ';}' 
<name> #PCDATA, the name of the program, the version, the build, and any other information about 
the emitting program can be listed here. Word 2002 lists {\*\generator Microsoft Word 
10.0.XXXX} – Word 2003 lists {\*\generator Microsoft Word 11.0.XXXX} – Word 2007 lists 
{\*\generator Microsoft Word 12.0.XXXX} in which XXXX is replaced by the build number. 
Only ASCII text is allowed in this field. 
Document Area 
Once the RTF header is defined, the RTF reader has enough information to correctly read the 
actual document text. The <document> contains document information followed by one or more 
sections. It has the following syntax: 
<document> <info>? <xmlnstbl>? <docfmt>* <section>+ 
Information Group 
The \info control word introduces the information group, which contains information about the 
document. This can include the title, author, keywords, comments, and other information 
specific to the file. This information is for use by a document-management tool, if available. 
The information group has the following syntax: 
<info> '{' \info <title>? & <subject>? & <author>? & <manager>? & <company>? <operator>? &

Read-Only Password Protection 
This control word contains hex-encoded encrypted data representing the password needed to 
edit the given RTF document. For more information on the encryption algorithm used, please 
see the WordprocessingML element documentProtection discussed in Office Open XML.  
Read-Only Password Protection consists of a single control word with the following syntax: Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

<passwordhash> '{\*' \passwordhash #SDATA '}' 
 
For example:  
{\*\passwordhash 
010000004c000000010000000480000050c300001400000010000000f89c360d0c9d360d000000008bc29e2f78a2144122ed6
8a1701e2ea50bbbbeaf7333c40dfe048ccf55f709b8cc7e8b49} 
Note: the control word \password was supported by Word 2003, but has been deprecated because it is not as 
secure (uses weak encryption) 
XML Namespace Table 
XML Namespace tables contain the namespaces for XML and SmartTags that are used in an RTF-
formatted document.  
 
SmartTags and custom XML markup each provide a facility for embedding customer-defined 
semantics into the document as follows:  
 SmartTags use the ability to provide a basic namespace or name for a run or set of runs in a 
document (see Custom XML Tags) 
 Custom XML markup uses the ability to tag the document that uses XML elements and 
attributes that are specified by any valid XML Schema file. 
 
The XML Namespace table has the following syntax: 
<xmlnstbl> '{\*' \xmlnstbl <xmlnsdecl>* '}' 
<xmlnsdecl> '{' \xmlnsN #PCDATA '}' 
 
For example: 
{\*\xmlnstbl{\xmlns1 {HYPERLINK "http://exampleuri.org"}}} 
The following table lists the Namespace Table control words: 
 
Control word Meaning 
\*\xmlnstbl XML namespace table 
\xmlnsN XML namespace table entry. This control word is also used in the body text to identify data 
belonging to the corresponding namespace (see Custom XML Tags) 
Document Formatting Properties 
After the information group and XML namespace table (if they are present), there may be some 
document formatting control words (referred to as <docfmt> in the document area syntax 
description). These control words are listed in the following table and specify document 
attributes, such as margins and footnote placement. These attributes must precede the first 
plain-text character in the document. Measurements are in twips, one-twentieth of a point. For 
omitted control words, RTF uses the default values. 
Note that three of the document-protection control words (\formprot, \revprot, and 
\annotprot) are mutually exclusive; only one of the three can apply to any given document. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 42 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
On the other hand, \readprot indicates that the document is set to Read-Only protection, but 
allows exceptions, and can appear with \annotprot control words for backward compatibility.

\ilfomacatclnupN  If N = 1, this control word specifies that the last attempt made by the application to remove 
unused abstract numbering definitions from the document was incomplete. If a legacy 
document is opened by a consumer, it may choose to remove abstract numbering definitions 
that are 'orphaned' (have no associated numbering definition instances) This control word is 
used by those consumers to indicate their progress (if incomplete)in reviewing existing 
abstract numbering definitions.  
Note: Removing unused abstract numbering definition from a document will reduce the file 
size, but is not required.  
If omitted or N = 0, then all abstract numbering definitions shall be considered reviewed.

yrelyonvmlN  If N = 1, applications may utilize the Vector Mark-up Language (VML) when saving the 
content of this RTF document as a Web page, when graphical elements that can use this 
format are present in the document. 
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, then a graphic image format should be used either in 
place of or in concert with the VML output to specify the formatting and positioning for 
objects that are part of the resulting Web page. 
Note: This setting is intended for applications to save Web pages that can be supported by 
legacy Web browsers that do not support VML when attempting to read and display the 
resulting Web page.  
\validatexmlN  If N = 1, applications should validate the custom XML markup in this document against the 
applicable custom XML schema(s) when those schemas are available. If N = 0, the 
application should silently behave as if it was unable to provide this functionality. 
If this control word is omitted, then applications that support this functionality should attempt 
to validate the custom XML contents against any available related custom XML schema(s) Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
\*\xform  This destination control word specifies the location of a custom XSL transform that shall be 
used when this document is saved as a single XML file. 
Note: Because this setting specifies behavior when saving to an alternative file format not 
defined by Office Open XML, this behavior is optional.  
If this element is omitted, then no custom XSL transform shall be used when saving this file 
as a single XML file. If the \usexform control word is omitted, then this transform shall not 
be applied when the document is saved as a single XML file. 
For example, consider the RTF specifying to save through the XSL transform located at 
c:\temp\myxslt.xsl: 
{\*\xform c:\\temp\\myxslt.xsl} 
\donotembedsysfontN  If N = 0, applications should embed common system fonts when they are in use and font 
embedding is enabled for this document. Common system fonts refer to a set of fonts that 
are typically always present on a computer, and are not defined by this spec. 
If this control word is omitted or N = 1, then the set of fonts defined as common system 
fonts should not be embedded in the current document when font embedding is turned on.  
\donotembedlingdataN  Speech, handwriting and controls text service data received from devices connected to 
Microsoft Office using the Windows Text Service Framework Application Programming 
Interface should (N = 0)or should not (N = 1) be embedded in the given RTF document.  
\showplaceholdtextN If N = 1, each custom XML control word within this document should always show some form 
of in-document placeholder text representation when it contains no run content. If 
placeholder text is not specified, then the application shall use the name of the control word 
to generate default placeholder text in its place. 
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, then custom XML markup that does not have 
placeholder text specified within its properties should not display any placeholder text. 
\trackmovesN If N = 1, applications should track moves when the \revisions control word is present. If 
move tracking is not enabled (\revisions control word is not present, or is inactive) what 
would otherwise be considered moves are tracked as deletions (\deleted) and insertions 
(\revised) If N = 0, moves should not be tracked. 
\trackformattingN If N = 1, applications should track revisions made to the formatting of this RTF document 
when the \revisions control word is present. If N = 0, formatting should not be tracked. 
\ignoremixedcontentN If N = 1, applications should ignore all text content that is not contained within a leaf custom 
XML markup control word when validating the contents of the custom XML markup in this 
document against one or more attached custom XML schema(s) 
A leaf control word is a custom XML control word that has no child custom XML control words 
(it is a leaf in the custom XML tree) 
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, then text content in leaf control words should not be 
ignored when validating the custom XML markup against one or more custom XML 
schema(s) 
\saveinvalidxmlN If N = 1, this document should be capable of being saved into a format consisting of a single 
XML file when its contents are not valid based on the custom XML markup contained in the 
document. This setting has no effect on documents that do not contain custom XML markup, 
or that do contain custom XML markup but do not have a schema attached.  
Note: Because this setting specifies behavior when saving to an alternative file format not 
defined by this spec, this behavior is optional.  
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, then applications should not allow this document to 
be saved into a single XML file when its contents are not valid based on the custom XML 
markup contained in the document.  
If the \validatexmlN control word is present, then the XML is never invalid and this property 
is ignored. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
\showxmlerrorsN If N = 1, a visual cue should be displayed on content contained in custom XML markup in an 
RTF document that is considered to be invalid based on the associated XML schema(s) 
If this control word is not present in an RTF document or N = 0, visual cues should be not 
displayed. 
\stylelocktheme This control word specifies whether applications shall prevent the modification of the 
document's theme information when editing this document. This setting should not preclude 
the use of the theme information; instead, it should only prevent the modification of the 
theme part in a single operation (either through a user interface or a programmatic 
operation) 
If this control word is omitted, then applications may allow the replacement or modification of 
the theme part in this document. 
\stylelockqfset This control word specifies whether applications shall prevent the replacement of the 
complete set of styles when editing this document. This setting should not preclude the 
editing or removal of individual styles; instead, it should only prevent the removal and 
replacement of the entire styles part in a single operation (either through a user interface or 
a programmatic operation) 
If this control word is omitted, then applications may allow the replacement of the entire 
styles part in this document. 
\usenormstyforlist This control word specifies whether applications shall automatically apply their list paragraph 
style when numbering is applied to a paragraph currently formatted using the default 
paragraph style. 
Typically, when a paragraph is formatted using the default paragraph style, and numbering is 
subsequently applied, the list paragraph style is applied to ensure that paragraph properties 
are appropriate for a numbered paragraph.  
This control word specifies that no alternate paragraph style shall ever be applied. 
\*\wgrffmtfilter  This control word is followed by a four-digit hexadecimal string that specifies a set of 
suggested filters that should be applied to the list of document styles in the application if the 
styles are displayed in a user interface. The is any combination of the following filtering 
hexadecimal values OR'd together:

styles. 
0080 Specifies that table styles should be displayed in the list of document styles. 
0100 Specifies that all unique forms of run-level direct formatting should be displayed 
in the list of document styles as though they were each a unique style. 
0200 Specifies that all unique forms of paragraph-level direct formatting should be 
displayed in the list of document styles as though they were each a unique style. 
0400 Specifies that all unique forms of direct formatting of numbering data should be 
displayed in the list of document styles as though they were each a unique style. 
0800 Specifies that all unique forms of direct formatting of tables should be displayed 
in the list of document styles as though they were each a unique style. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
1000 Specifies that a style should be present that removes all formatting and styles 
from text. 
2000 Specifies that the first three heading styles should always be displayed in the list 
of document styles. 
4000 Specifies that styles should only be shown if the \ssemihiddenN control word is 
0 and the \shidden control word isn't present. 
8000 Specifies that primary names for styles should not be shown if an alternate name 
using the name control word exists. 
Any 
other 
value 
Undefined. Shall not be used. 
 
If this control word is omitted, then all settings defined by this control word are turned off. 
Example: Consider an RTF document containing the following: 
{\*\wgrffmtfilter 2002} 
This specifies two suggested filter options for the list of document styles: 
1) Only custom styles should be shown (0002) 
2) Heading styles with a style ID of Heading1 to Heading3 should always be displayed 
in the list (2000) 
\readonlyrecommended  Specifies that this document is recommended to be read-only.  
\stylesortmethodN This control word specifies a suggested sorting that should be applied to the list of document 
styles in this application if the styles are displayed in a user interface. 
If this control word is omitted styles should be sorted as if this control word was present with 
N = 1. 
Value Description 
0 Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by their names. 
1 Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by the default sorting of the host 
application. 
Note: In Microsoft Office Word 2007 the default sorting order is specified by 
the \spriorityN control word.  
2 Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by the font for which they apply. 
3 Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by the style on which they are 
based. 
4 Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by their style types (e.g., 
character, linked, paragraph) 
Any other 
value 
Undefined. Shall not be used. 
 
\*\writereservhash  This control word contains hex-encoded encrypted data representing the password needed to 
edit the given RTF document. For more information on the encryption algorithm used please 
see the WordprocessingML element documentProtection discussed in Office Open XML. This is 
a destination control word. 
\*\writereservation This destination control word was used in Word 2003 but has been deprecated in favor of 
\writereservhash since \writereservation uses weak encryption. 
\saveprevpict  This control word specifies if a document’s thumbnail should be generated for the contents of 
the first page of this document when saved by an application that supports document 
thumbnail generationK

Control word Meaning 
\forceupgrade This control word specifies that the contents of the document may be upgraded and that the 
resulting document shall not have its functionality limited to only those functions compatible 
with earlier word processing applications. The only action required as part of upgrading the 
document is the instantiation of the \nofeaturethrottle1 and/or \nouicompat control 
words.  
Note: At the time of Microsoft Office Word 2007 release, respecting this control word means 
that all compatibility options in the document that maintain compatibility with previous word 
processing applications shall be removed from the file or set to “0” with the exception of:  
 \nospaceforul 
 \lnbrkrule 
 \noxlattoyen 
 \expshrtn 
 \dntultrlspc 
 \dntblnsbdbwid 
 \dontadjustlineheightintable 
If an application does not know how to upgrade a document, this control word and the 
\nofeaturethrottleN and \nouicompat control words should be ignored and persisted. 
Note: The remaining operations that shall be performed as part of upgrading the document 
are application-defined and outside the scope of this specification.  
\noafcnsttbl This control word specifies whether applications shall allow tables to be resized to the 
remaining available line width when they are using the AutoFit algorithm, and part of that 
line is filled by a shape with a wrapping type of square or tight.  
Typically, a table that is AutoFit and has a preferred width shall have its width reduced to 
allow a floating shape to wrap around its contents within the document, as that shape 
reduces the width of the line and the AutoFit algorithm applies to the remaining line width.  
This control word specifies that tables shall never have any preferred width overridden to 
allow them to wrap around that floating object, and shall instead be pushed to the next full 
width line in the document to be displayed. 
Example: Consider an RTF document with a floating shape centered in the document, 
followed by a table with preferred cell widths of 2.22", as follows: 

 
The default presentation of this document overrides the preferred cell widths to force the 
table to fit on the line next to the floating shape with tight wrapping. 
However, if this compatibility setting’s parameter is “1” then that table is not resized, so it 
cannot fit and must be pushed to the next full width lineI resulting in the following outputW Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

characters can begin or end a line when kinsoku line breaking rules are enabled. 
Specifically, the following settings shall be used instead (for brevity, only those settings that 
are different than the default behavior of Microsoft Office Word 2007 are listed below)

marked as Chinese (Simplified)that begins with a % symbol, as follows: 
%... 
Typically, the kinsoku settings for Chinese (Simplified)do not allow this character to begin a 
line, so the character before that symbol would be moved down onto this line: 
〖%... 
However, if this compatibility setting is present, then the alternate kinsoku rules are in place, 
which do not prevent the % character from beginning the new line, resulting in the following 
output: 
%... 
 Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003 
\indrlsweleven This control word specifies whether applications should ignore the presence of floating 
objects when calculating the starting position of paragraphs that are wrapped around floating 
objects defined using the Vector Mark-up Language (VML) syntax. 
Typically a floating object on the same line or lines as a paragraph only affects the text when 
the floating object occurs where that text would normally be presented.  
Example: Text at a 1" indentation would only be displaced by a floating object that appears 
at that position and not one that appears from 0" to 0.5" on the same line. 
This control word specifies that floating objects shall always impact paragraphs on the same Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
line in two ways: 
1. If the paragraph is not numbered, then it shall tightly wrap any floating object that 
precedes it on the same line, ignoring its own indentation settings.  
Example: A paragraph with a 1" left indent shall tightly wrap a floating object that 
appears at only 0.25" on the same line.  
2. If the paragraph is numbered, then it shall calculate and use its full indent relative 
to the edge of the floating object, not relative to the edge of the page.  
Example: A numbered paragraph with a 1" left indent shall appear 1.5" into the 
page if it is preceded by a floating object that appears at 0.5" on the same line.  
Example: Consider an RTF document with a narrow floating object at 0.5" on the page, 
surrounded by both numbered and unnumbered paragraphs. The default presentation would 
have no impact on the paragraphs based on that floating object, since the two do not 
intersect: 

 

 
However if this control word is present, the two alternate rules defined above apply, resulting 
in the following output: 

 
 
 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\nocxsptable  
 
This control word specifies whether the suppression of additional space (contextual spacing)
shall be applied to paragraphs contained within tables. 
Typically, the rules for the removal of additional paragraph spacing are applied to all 
paragraphs in an RTF document. This control word specifies that this setting shall always be 
ignored for paragraphs in table cells (and additional spacing shall be allowed) 
Example: Consider an RTF document with a default paragraph style with additional spacing 
after and contextual spacing set: 
The default presentation would have the spacing suppressed between all paragraphs, since Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

they are all of the default paragraph style: 

 
However, if this control word was present, then the paragraphs in the table will never have 
their spacing suppressed, resulting in the following output: 

 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\notcvasp This control word specifies whether applications shall vertically align the contents of a table 
cell, even when the contents of that table cell include one or more floating objects defined 
using the Vector Mark-up Language syntax. Note that the floating object must be part of the 
cell, and not displayed over the cell due to its anchoring relative to another part of the 
document. 
Typically, if the alignment of a table cell in an RTF document is specified, then the entire 
contents of that cell are aligned as specified [Example: The entire contents of the cell are 
centered vertically and moved right-aligned horizontally at that point. End example  
This control word specifies that whenever a floating object defined using VML is present in a 
table cell that no vertical alignment shall be applied to the contents of that cell, and the 
contents of the cell shall instead always be top aligned to the cell's contents. 
Example: Consider an RTF table with two cells, each containing some text and a single shape 
defined using the Vector Mark-up Language syntax. The first cell is vertically aligned to the 
bottom of the cell, and the second cell is vertically aligned to the center of the cell. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 
The default presentation of this document results in each cell (including the extents of the 
floating objects) being vertically aligned as specified, as follows: 

 
However, if this control word is present, then the presence of a floating object in each cell 
shall result in the vertical alignment setting being ignored (each vertical alignment shall be 
top-aligned relative to the cell) resulting in the following output: 

 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\notvatxbx This control word specifies that vertical alignment within textboxes shall be ignored and 
instead the contents of the textbox shall always be top-aligned.

following output: 

 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\spltpgpar This control word specifies whether a page break shall automatically complete the line on 
which it appears, moving the end of the paragraph to a new line on the next page, or if it 
shall behave as true run-level content within its current paragraph. 
Typically, a page break is treated as run-level content, which means that although it delimits 
the end of the page, if there is no content after it within the current paragraph that the 
paragraph shall also end on that page.  
This control word specifies that a page break shall always immediately end the current page, 
moving the paragraph mark that delimits the end of its parent paragraph to a new line on 
the next page. 
Note that this setting only affects the case where there is no run-level content after the page 
break within the paragraph – if any further run content appears in the paragraph it shall 
appear on subsequent lines on the next pageK

the first line of the second page, resulting in the following output: 

 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\hwelev This control word specifies whether applications should assume that all characters in the 
Hangul Syllables Unicode sub range (character values between 0xAC00 and 0xD7FF)are of a 
single fixed width or shall use the characters’ widths defined by the font in use (typical for a

Control word Meaning 

 
Notice from the highlighting that the characters have been compressed to the width of the 
single character and displayed at that fixed width.  
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\afelev This control word specifies that when performing an AutoFit on a table in an RTF document to 
display it, applications shall alter that logic slightly to mimic the behavior of a previous word 
processing application. Specifically, if the width of a grid column in a table has been set by a 
preferred table cell width, then that column's width may be enlarged by the content of cells 
which themselves do not have a preferred width (in contrast, the normal logic never allows 
the content of cells to override a preferred width on a grid column) 
\cachedcolbal This control word specifies that cached paragraph information shall be used for column 
balancing. Specifically, this control word specifies that when a paragraph's lines have 
differing heights, an application shall treat this paragraph as though it had only one line 
equaling the full paragraph height, regardless of the actual number of lines in the paragraph. 
Note: It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was 
deprecated due to issues with its output and is maintained only for compatibility with existing 
documents from a legacy application.  
Typically, lines are correctly measured for their height when balancing columns as part of an 
RTF document. This control word specifies that applications shall perform the incorrect 
calculation in the conditions described above. 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\utinl This control word specifies whether applications shall underline the character following the 
numbering defined when both the numbering itself and the first letter of the corresponding 
numbered paragraph are underlined. 
Typically, the tab or space character generated between numbering and the corresponding 
paragraph of text is never formatted, since it is automatically generated. This control word 
specifies that the tab or space shall be underlined the same way as the numbering symbol 
itself in the following conditions: 
The numbering is underlined 
The first character of the paragraph is underlined 
Example: Consider an RTF document with two numbered paragraphs: one with underlined 
text and the other without. The default presentation would have the tab characters free of 
underlining in both cases: 

 
However, if this control word is present, then the second paragraph meets the criteria 
defined above for having the suffix character underlined, resulting in the following output: Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Document Properties

Control word Meaning 

 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003. 
\notbrkcnstfrctbl  This control word specifies whether applications shall allow a table row to be split in two 
when its contents are displayed under the following circumstances: 
The table row exceeds one page in height (it must be split across two pages) 
The table row would need to be split to accommodate a floating table also on the page 
This control word, when present, specifies that table rows that exceed one page in height 
shall never be split around floating tables in the document, and shall instead be displayed on 
the first page below the floating table, even if that means that part of the table row is clipped 
by the edge of the page. 
Example: Consider an RTF document with a long single table row that must be split across 
two separate pages in the document, to accommodate a floating table anchored in the 
footer, as follows: 

 
The default presentation of this document forces that row to be split as needed around that 
floating table. 
However, if this control word is present, then that table row is never split around the floating 
table, so it is always placed below that floating table on the page, and allowed to flow off the 
page as needed, resulting in the following output: 

 
This example, while extreme, shows how the row is placed below the floating table, rather 
than breaking around it.

Control word Meaning 
\krnprsnet This control word specifies whether applications shall use the ANSI or Unicode kerning pair 
information from fonts stored in the document when displaying those characters within the 
document's contents. 
Typically, applications shall use the Unicode kerning pair information to determine all 
possible kerning pairs in the fonts in use. This control word, when present specifies that the 
ANSI kerning information shall be used instead. 
\usexform This control word specifies that this document should be saved through the custom XSLT 
transform defined by the \xform control word in this document when it is saved as a single 
XML file (not defined by this specification) 
Note: Because this setting specifies behavior when saving to an alternative file format not 
defined by this spec, this behavior is optional.  
If this element is omitted, then this document should not be saved through a custom XSL 
transform when it is saved as a single XML file.

Mail Merge 
Mail merge refers to an operation by which RTF documents work together with data from an 
external data source, importing the data into a document according to a set of codes that are 
contained in RTF tags that are also known as fields (\field).  
 
An RTF document that contains the \*\mailmerge control word is connected to an external data 
source. This document is known as a source document. In addition to being connected to an 
external data source and containing fields, a source document may contain any regular RTF 
constructs. These include the following:

These control words are described in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\*\mailmerge Specifies all the mail merge information for a document that has been connected to an 
external data source as part of a mail merge operation. 
\mmlinktoquery Specifies that the current RTF document's query string, stored in the <mmquery> control 
word and used to specify the data to be imported from the external data source, actually 
contains a reference to an external query file that contains the actual query data to be used 
against the specified external data source for the mail merge. This query shall mimic a 
STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE query and be of the following form: SELECT * FROM 
<query file path>. 
 
If this element is omitted, the query specified for the data source that is attached to the 
current document shall be assumed to not be a query that contains a link to an external file. 
\mmdefaultsql Specifies if a given merged RTF document shall prompt its conforming hosting application to 
use the default STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE query string. The default STRUCTURED 
QUERY LANGUAGE query string for merged RTF documents is "SELECT * FROM 
<datasource>".  
\*\mmconnectstrdata Specifies the hexadecimal-encoded connection string used to reconnect to an external data 
source. 
\*\mmconnectstr Destination taking #PCDATA which has been replaced by \mmconnectstrdata because the 
connect string is very long and may be truncated. 
\mmquery Specifies the Structured Query Language string that shall be run against the specified 
external data source to return the set of records from the external data that shall be 
imported into merged RTF documents when the mail merge operation is performed. If this 
control word is omitted, no query shall be associated with the current data source. 
\mmdatasource Specifies the location of the external data source to be connected to a given RTF document. 
\mmheadersource Specifies the location of a file that contains the column header information that shall be 
used when connecting to an external data source that does not have column header data 
specified. Specifically, this control word specifies a file that corresponds with the external 
data source specified by the <mmdatasource> control word. 
 
Note: Column headers are needed to enable a hosting application to associate an external 
data source's columns to fields via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word. 
\mmblanklinks Specifies how an application performing the mail merge shall handle blank lines in the 
merged documents resulting from the mail merge. Typically, when a mail merge is 
performed, any blank lines that result from lines whose sole contents are merge fields with 
no content are removed from the merged document to prevent extraneous blank lines from 
appearing in the merged documents. When this control word is present, the merged 
documents that are generated from the mail merge shall not have any blank lines removed 
before they are sent to their destination format. 
 
If this control word is omitted, the merged documents that are generated from this mail 
merge shall have all blank lines suppressed if they consist of only merge fields with values 
that consist of empty strings. 
\mmaddfieldname Specifies the column within a given external data source that contains e-mail addresses. 
This control word is specified independently of the field mappings specified for a given 
merged document via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word. 
 
If this control word is omitted, or if no column exists in the data source with this column 
name, the source document specifies that no e-mail address data shall be associated with 
this mail merge. 
 
Note: This control word is generally used to allow you to send in e-mail merged documents 
resulting from populating the fields within a merged document with external data. 
 
This control word is independent of the field mapping that is specified for a given merged 
document via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word. This separation enables applications 
to e-mail the documents resulting from the population of RTF fields with external data Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Mail Merge

Control word Meaning 
regardless of the presence or absence of a field mapped to external data specifying e-mail 
addresses. 
\mmmailsubject Specifies the text that shall appear in the subject line of the e-mail messages or faxes that 
result after the actions of a mail merge have imported external data into fields within a 
merged RTF document whose destination is e-mail or fax as specified by the 
<mmdestemail> or <mmdestfax> control words. 
 
If this control word is omitted, no subject line text shall be associated with each merged 
document produced via a mail merge using the specified mail merge data. If the 
<mmdestemail> or <mmdestfax> control words are not used, this control word shall be 
ignored. 
\mmattach Specifies that, after importing external data into fields to generate a series of destination 
RTF documents as e-mail messages, the resulting documents should be sent in e-mailed as 
an attachment rather than the body of the actual e-mail message. 
 
If the <mmdestemail> control word is not present, this control word shall be ignored. 
\mmshowdata Specifies that a specific merged document shall display the data from the specified external 
data source where merge fields have been inserted. The <mmreccur> control word is used 
to specify the record within the external data source that is to have its applicable data 
displayed where applicable within the RTF merged document. 
 
If the <mmreccur> control word is not present in the RTF for the document leveraging this 
control word, the hosting application may behave as if the <mmreccur> control word's 
parameter was equal to 1. 
\mmreccurN Specifies that the hosting application shall display the given record from the specified 
external data source in place of the fields to which its data is mapped via the 
<mmodsofldmpdata> control word in a merged document. When this control word is 
present, the parameter shall specify the one-based index of the record from that data 
source that shall be used to populate this document. 
 
If the <mmreccur> control word is omitted with the <mmshowdata> control word present, 
the hosting application shall behave as if the <mmreccur> control word’s parameter was 
equal to NK ff the Ymmshowdata[ control word is omittedI this control word shall be 
ignored. If the <mmreccur> control word’s parameter is less than 1 or greater than the 
number of records in the specified external data sourceI the hosting application shall treat 
this parameter as if it were equal to NK 
ymmerrorsN Specifies the type of error reporting that shall be conducted by an application when 
performing a mail merge against the specified source data. 
 
The type of error reporting implied by this control word shall be defined as follows:  
• Simulate the population of fields with mapped external data, and report errors in a new 
document if the parameter is equal to 1. 
• While populating fields with mapped external data pause to report each error as it occurs if 
the parameter is equal to 2. 
• Populate fields with mapped external data, and report errors in a new document if the 
parameter is equal to 3. 
• If this control word is omitted, or if its parameter is set to a parameter outside those specified 
above, its parameter shall be assumed to be 2.

Control word Meaning 
\*\mmodso Specifies a group of additional settings for the mail merge information included as part of 
the current document, the sum total of which is referred to as the Office Data Source Object 
(ODSO)settings for the mail merge. 
 
If the <mmdatatypeodso> control word is not used, the settings that are specified within 
this control word may be ignored in favor of their non-ODSO equivalents. 
\*\mmodsoudldata Specifies the Universal Data Link (UDL) connection string used to reconnect to an external 
data source. The destination specified by this control word shall contain the hexadecimal 
encoding of the connection string that the hosting application shall pass to a external data 
source access application to enable the RTF document to be reconnected to the specified 
external data source. 
 
If this destination is omitted, no UDL connection string shall be associated with the ODSO 
data for this mail merge. 
 
This connection string is only used under the following conditions:  
• The <mmdatatypeodso> control word is used in the given RTF file. 
• The current application is able to use the ODSO information to access the data source. 
 
\*\mmodsoudl Destination for #PCDATA replaced by \mmodsoudldata because Universal Data Link 
(UDL) string is very long and suffers truncation 
\mmodsotable Specifies the particular set of data that a source or merged RTF document shall be 
connected to within an external data source that contains multiple data sets. In other 
words, when connecting an RTF document to an external data source that may have more 
than one repository of data within it, such as a database that has multiple tables or a 
spreadsheet that has multiple worksheets, this control word is used to distinguish the 
specific table or spreadsheet from which data will be imported from within the external data 
source. 
\mmodsosrc Specifies the location of the external data source to be connected to a given RTF document 
to perform the mail merge. 
 
This control word is used to specify the location of the external data source only under the 
following conditions:  
• The <mmdatatypeodso> control word is used in the given RTF file. 
• The current application is able to use the ODSO information to access the data source. 
 
\*\mmodsofilter Specifies the data records within the external data source that are to be included within the 
mail merge. 
 
If the destination of this control word conflicts with the <mmodsoudldata> control word, the 
<mmodsoudldata> control word shall take precedence. 
\*\mmodsosort Specifies the order in which the data records within the external data source are to be 
included within the mail merge. 
 
If the destination of this control word conflicts with the <mmodsoudldata> control word, the 
<mmodsoudldata> control word shall take precedence. 
\*\mmodsofldmpdata Specifies how a column specified in the external data source that has been connected to an 
RTF document shall be mapped to the fields (\field)within the given merged document's 
contents. Each instance of an <mmodsofldmpdata> control word contains the information 
that is needed to map one column in the external data source to a single type of field for 
the purposes of the mail merge in the current document. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Mail Merge

Control word Meaning 
\mmodsoname Specifies the column name within a given external data source for the column whose index 
is specified via the <mmodsofmcolumn> control word. This data source name provides a 
column name that shall be used to map a specific field in the document, as specified by the 
<mmodsofldmpdata> control word. The parameter of this control word specifies the name 
of this column in the data source when the connection is initially established that is then 
used permanently to link columns in the database to fields in the document. 
 
If this control word is omitted, no data source name is provided for the current column. 
\mmodsomappedname Specifies the predefined RTF field name that shall be mapped to the column number 
specified by the <mmodsofmcolumn> control word within an instance of the 
<mmodsofldmpdata>. 
 
If the application does not have a predefined merge field whose name matches the name 
specified using the destination of this control word, this control word may be ignored. 
\mmodsofmcolumnN Specifies the zero-based index of the column within a given external data source that shall 
be mapped to the local name of a specific MERGEFIELD field specified by the parent field 
mapping data. The parameter specifies this index value, which is used to look up the 
appropriate column in the data source. 
 
If this control word is omitted, or if its value exceeds the number of columns in the 
associated data source, the index of the referenced column shall be assumed to be 0. 
\mmodsodynaddrN Specifies that the contents of the AddressBlock field shall be dynamically ordered based on 
the country associated with the current record or if the country-invariant version of the 
address field shall be used in its place. 
 
If this control word is omitted, the form of the address shall be dynamically determined 
based on the country specified in the current record. 
\mmodsolidN Specifies the language ID (see standard language table)for the language that was used to 
generate the merge field name that was associated with a given column in the data source. 
This control word specifies that when this field mapping is processed by an application, it 
shall interpret the merge field name as the name for the specified language. 
 
If this control word is omitted, the mapped field names specified in the current document 
may be interpreted using any method desired by the consuming application. In other words, 
no language data is included with the field mapping information. 
\mmodsocoldelimN Specifies the character that shall be interpreted as the column delimiter used to separate 
columns within external data sources. The character representing the specific delimiter used 
for the external data source referenced by a source or merged RTF document is specified 
via a decimal number representing the decimal number for the Unicode character 
representation within this control word’s parameterK 
 
ff this control word is omittedI no column delimiter shall be specified for the data source in 
this mail mergeK 
ymmjdsotypeN Specifies the type of external data source to be connected to as part of the ODSO 
connection information for this mail merge. This setting is purely a suggestion of the data 
source type that is being used for this mail merge. This setting may be ignored in favor of 
an alternative mechanism if one is present. 
\mmodsofhdrN Specifies that a hosting application shall treat the first row of data in the specified external 
data source as a header row containing the names of each column in the data source, 
rather than data to populate mapped fields in a merged document. 
 
If this control word is omitted, the first row of the data source shall not be considered a 
header row when a mail merge is performed. 
\*\mmodsorecipdata Specifies all of the inclusion/exclusion data for the contents of the specified mail merge data 
source. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Mail Merge

Control word Meaning 
\mmodsoactiveN Specifies whether a specific record from the specified external data source shall be imported 
into a merged RTF document when the mail merge defined for a source document is 
performed. If this control word’s parameter is set to 0, the record specified by the parent 
control word shall not be used to create a merged documentK 
 
ff this control word is omitted for a given recordI the data record associated with it shall be 
imported into a merged oqc document when the mail merge is performedK 
ymmodsohashN Specifies a unique hash value used to maintain a relationship between a specific record 
within an external data source and a given source or merged document. 
\mmodsocolumnN Specifies the column within the specified external data source that contains unique data for 
the current record within that data source. This control word shall be used in conjunction 
with the \mmodsouniquetag control word to maintain a relationship between a specific 
record within an external data source and a given source or merged document. The 
parameter of this control word shall be interpreted as a zero-based index into the columns 
specified by the data source, specifying the resulting column as the column in which the 
<mmodsouniquetag> control word shall be looked up. 
 
If this control word specifies a column number that exceeds the number of columns in the 
specified external data source, its value shall be ignored. 
\mmodsouniquetag Destination for unique tag as described in the previous entry. 
 
Mail Merge Field Map Data Type 
The control words in the following table specify the data type of the mapped mail merge field. 
Control word Meaning 
\mmfttypenull Mail merge field map data type is null. 
\mmfttypedbcolumn Mail merge field map data type is database column. 
\mmfttypeaddress Mail merge field map data type is address block. 
\mmfttypesalutation Mail merge field map data type is salutation. 
\mmfttypemapped Mail merge field map data type is mapped. 
\mmfttypebarcode Mail merge field map data type is barcode. 
  
Mail Merge Destination 
This specifies the possible results that may be generated when a mail merge is carried out on a 
given RTF source document. In other words, this control word is used to specify what is to be 
done with the merged documents that result from populating the fields in a given merged RTF 
document with data from the specified external data source.

The color, width, border style, and border spacing keywords for page borders are the same as 
the keywords defined for paragraph borders. 
Headers and Footers 
Headers and footers are RTF destinations. Each section in the document can have its own set of 
headers and footers. If no headers or footers are defined for a given section, the headers and 
footers from the previous section (if any) are used. Headers and footers have the following 
syntax: 
<hdrftr> '{' <hdrctl> <para>+ '}' <hdrftr>? 
<hdrctl> \header | \footer | \headerl | \headerr | \headerf | \footerl | \footerr | \footerf 
Note: Each separate <hdrftr> group must have a distinct <hdrctl> introducing it. 
Control word Meaning 
\header Header on all pages. This is a destination control word. 
\footer Footer on all pages. This is a destination control word. 
\headerl Header on left pages only. This is a destination control word. 
\headerr Header on right pages only. This is a destination control word. 
\headerf Header on first page only. This is a destination control word. 
\footerl Footer on left pages only. This is a destination control word. 
\footerr Footer on right pages only. This is a destination control word. 
\footerf Footer on first page only. This is a destination control word. 
 
Note: Prior to the Microsoft Word 2007, only the \footer keyword and/or the \header keyword 
wer written if the "facing pages" (\facingp)option was disabled. Additionally, only the 
\headerl and \headerr keywords for the left and right headers, respectively, were written if 
the \facingp option was enabled. With the release of the Microsoft Word 2007, the \headerl 
keyword and the \headerr keyword are always written. Additionally, the \headerr keyword is 
written as the header on every page if the \facingp option is disabled.  
The \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and \footerr control words are used in conjunction with 
the \facingp control word, and the \headerf and \footerf control words are used in 
conjunction with the \titlepg control word. Many RTF readers will not function correctly if the 
appropriate document properties are not set. In particular, if \facingp is not set, then only 
\header and \footer can be used, but \headerr and \footerr should be used if \header and 
\footer are missing. If \facingp is set, then only \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and 
\footerr should be used. Combining both \facingp and \titlepg is allowed. You should not use 
\header to set the headers for both pages when \facingp is set. You can use \headerf if 
\titlepg is not set, but no header will appear. For more information, see Document Formatting 
Properties and Section Formatting Properties in this Specification. 
If the previous section had a first page header or footer and had \titlepg set, and the current 
section does not, then the previous section’s first page header or footer is not used for the 
current section. However, it is not destroyed; if subsequent sections have \titlepg set, then the 
first page header or footer is restored.
 
Paragraph Text 
There are two kinds of paragraphs: plain and table. A table is a collection of paragraphs. A table 
row is a contiguous series of paragraphs partitioned into cells. The \intbl control word marks Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting

the paragraph as being part of a table. Additional keywords related to table styles are 
documented next, and refer to properties of the cell the paragraph resides within. For more 
information, see the Table Definitions section of this Specification. This control word is inherited 
by subsequent paragraphs not reset by the \pard control word. 
<para> <textpar> | <row> 
<textpar> <pn>? <brdrdef>? <parfmt>* <apoctl>* <tabdef>? <shading>? (\v \spv)?

<nestrow> <nestcell>+ '{\*' \nesttableprops <tbldef> \nestrow '}' 
<nestcell> <textpar>+ \nestcell 
Paragraph Formatting Properties 
These control words (described as <parfmt> in the paragraph-text syntax description) specify 
generic paragraph formatting properties. These control words can appear anywhere in the body 
of the paragraph, not just at the beginning. 
Note: If the \pard control word is not present, the current paragraph inherits all paragraph properties from the 
previous paragraph. 
The paragraph-formatting control words are listed in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\par New paragraph. 
\pard Resets to default paragraph properties. 
\spv Style separator feature that causes the paragraph mark to not appear even in ShowAll. Used to 
nest paragraphs within the document view or outline without generating a new heading. 
\hyphpar Switches automatic hyphenation for the paragraph. Append 1 or nothing to toggle property on; 
append 0 to turn it off. 
\intbl Paragraph is part of a table. 
\itapN Paragraph nesting level, where 0 is the main document, 1 is a table cell, 2 is a nested table cell, 
3 is a doubly nested table cell, and so forth (default is 1). 
\keep Keep paragraph intact (completely on one page if possible). 
\keepn Keep paragraph with the next paragraph. 
\levelN N is the outline level of the paragraph. 
\noline No line numbering. 
\nowidctlpar No widow/orphan control. This is a paragraph-level property and is used to override the 
document-level \widowctrl. 
\widctlpar Widow/orphan control is used for the current paragraph. This is a paragraph property used to 
override the absence of the document-level \widowctrl. 
\outlinelevelN Outline level of paragraph. The N argument is a value from 0 to 8 representing the outline level 
of the paragraph. In the default case, no outline level is specified (same as body text) 
\pagebb Break page before the paragraph. 
\sbys Side-by-side paragraphs. 
\sN Designates paragraph style. If a paragraph style is specified, style properties must be specified 
with the paragraph. N references an entry in the style sheet. 
Table Style Specific 
\ytsN Designates the table style handle that was applied to the row/cell. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting

Control word Meaning 
\indmirror  This control word specifies whether the paragraph indents should be interpreted as mirrored 
indents. When this control word is present, the left indent shall become the inside indent and the 
right indent shall become the outside indent. 
If this control word is specified for this paragraph, then the inside page edge is the right page 
edge for odd numbered pages and the left page edge for even numbered pages. Conversely, the 
outside page edge is the left page edge for odd numbered pages and the right page edge for 
even numbered pages. 
If this control word is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting 
previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (that is that previous setting remains 
unchanged)If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then this property shall not 
be applied. 
Spacing 
\sbN Space before in twips (default is 0) 
\saN Space after in twips (default is 0) 
\sbautoN Auto spacing before: 
0 Space before determined by \sbN 
1 Space before is Auto (ignores \sbN) 
Default is 0. 
\saautoN Auto spacing after: 
0 Space after determined by \saN 
1 Space after is Auto (ignores \saN) 
Default is 0. 
\lisbN Space before in hundredths of a character unit. Overrides \sbN, although they should both be 
emitted with equivalent values. 
\lisaN Space after in hundredths of a character unit. Overrides \saN, although they should both be 
emitted with equivalent values. 
\slN Space between lines. If this control word is missing or if \sl0 is used, the line spacing is 
automatically determined by the tallest character in the line. If N is a positive value, this size is 
used only if it is taller than the tallest character (otherwise, the tallest character is used) if N is 
a negative value, the absolute value of N is used, even if it is shorter than the tallest character. 
\slmultN Line spacing multiple. Indicates that the current line spacing is a multiple of "Single" line spacing. 
This control word can follow only the \slN control word and works in conjunction with it. 
0 "At Least" or "Exactly" line spacing 
1 Multiple line spacing, relative to "Single" 
\nosnaplinegrid Disable snap line to grid. 
\contextualspace This control word specifies that any space specified before or after this paragraph should not be 
applied when the preceding and following paragraphs are of the same paragraph style, affecting 
the top and bottom spacing respectively.  
Example: This control word is typically used for paragraphs in lists, in which any space between 
subsequent list items, even if inherited from another style, is not desirable.  
If this control word is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting 
previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (that is that previous setting remains 
unchanged) 
If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then spacing is not ignored. If it is present, 
then the spacing above or below on this paragraph is subtracted from the spacing that would 
have been present if contextual spacing was not applied, never going below zero. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting

Tabs 
Any paragraph may have its own set of tabs. Tabs must follow this syntax: 
<tabdef> (<tab> | <bartab>) 
<tab> <tabkind>? <tablead>? \txN 
<bartab> <tablead>? \tbN 
<tabkind> \tqr | \tqc | \tqdec  
<tablead> \tldot | \tlmdot | \tlhyph | \tlul | \tlth | \tleq  
Control word Meaning 
\txN Tab position in twips from the left margin. 
\tqr Flush-right tab. 
\tqc Centered tab. 
\tqdec Decimal tab. 
\tbN Bar tab position in twips from the left margin. 
\tldot Leader dots. 
\tlmdot Leader middle dots. 
\tlhyph Leader hyphens. 
\tlul Leader underline. 
\tlth Leader thick line. 
\tleq Leader equal sign. 
 
Absolute Postion Tabs 
The control words given by <reltomargin> and <reltoindent> below specify that an absolute 
position tab character be placed at the current location in the run content. An absolute position 
tab is a character that is used to advance the position on the current line of text when displaying 
RTF content independently of custom tab stops defined using the \tbN and \txN control words. 
The resulting end position of the tab character is not affected by the addition of custom tab 
stops or changes to the value of the \deftabN control word. Absolute position tabs are defined 
to be adjusted left, center, or right relative to either the starting (in LTR paragraphs, left) 
margin or the starting indent. They are useful in headers and footers. 
If the alignment location specified by the positional tab cannot be found on the current line, 
because the starting location is past that point, then the tab character shall advance to that 
location on the next available line in the document. 
The syntax for absolute position tabs is: 
<ptab> '{' <ptableadding>? <relto> '}' 
<ptableadding>  \ptablnone | \ptabldot | \ptablminus | \ptabluscore | \ptablmdot 
<relto> <reltomargin> | <reltoindent> 
<reltomargin>  \pmartabql | \pmartabqc | \pmartabqr  
<reltoindend>  \pindtabql | \pindtabqc | \pindtabqr 
 
For example, here is the RTF specifying an absolute position “flush right” tab with leading dots 
between the left indent and the absolute tab: Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting

\pmartabqc  Center absolute position tab relative to the margin.  
\pmartabqr  Right absolute position tab relative to the margin.  
\pindtabql  Left absolute position tab relative to indent.  
\pindtabqc Center absolute position tab relative to indent.  
\pindtabqr Right absolute position tab relative to indent.  
Bullets and Numbering 
Word 6.0 and Word 95 RTF 
To provide compatibility with existing RTF readers, all applications that can automatically format 
paragraphs with bullets or numbers will also emit the generated text as plain text in the 
\pntext group. This allows existing RTF readers to capture the plain text and safely ignore the 
auto number instructions. This group precedes all bulleted or numbered paragraphs, and 
contains all the automatically generated text and formatting. It should precede the '{\*' \pn 
…'}' destination, and it is the responsibility of RTF readers that understand the '{\*' \pn … '}' 
destination to ignore the \pntext group. The following table defines the grammar of this group. 
<pn> <pnseclvl> | <pnpara> 
<pnseclvl> '{\*' \pnseclvlN <pndesc> '}'

Word 97 through Word 2007 RTF 
Each paragraph that is part of a list must contain some keyword to indicate the list that it is in, 
and the level of the list it belongs to. Word 97 through Word 2007 also provide the flat text 
representation of each number (in the \listtext destination) so, RTF readers that do not 
understand Word 97 numbering will get the paragraph number, along with appropriate character 
properties, inserted into their document at the beginning of the paragraph. Any RTF reader that 
does understand Word 97 through Word 2007 numbering should ignore the entire \listtext 
destination. 
Control word Meaning 
\lsN Should exactly match the \lsN for one of the list overrides in the List Override table. 
\ilvlN The 0-based level of the list to which the paragraph belongs. For all simple lists, N should always 
be 0. For multilevel lists, it can be 0 through 8. The value 9 is never used. The values 10 through 
12 have the special meanings for documents generated by Word 6: 10 = ilvlBullet (a bulleted 
paragraph in Word 6) 11 = ilvlList (a numbered paragraph in Word 6) 12 = ilvlContinue (a 
paragraph that was not itself numbered, but took its indenting scheme from its numbering 
properties and did not “break” numbering (that in Word 6 required otherwise contiguous 
paragraphs) 
\listtext Contains the flat text representation (<char>) of the number, including character properties. 
Should be ignored by any reader that understands Word 97 through Word 2007 numbering. This 
is a destination control word. 
 
Revision Marks for Paragraph Numbers and ListNum Fields 
Paragraph numbers and ListNum fields track revision information with special properties applied 
to the paragraph mark and ListNum field, respectively. The special properties hold the "old" 
value of the number—the value it held when revision-mark tracking began. At display time, 
Word checks the number's current value and compares it with this "old" value to determine 
whether it has changed. If the numbers are different, the old value shows up as deleted and the 
new value as inserted. If the numbers are the same, Word displays the new value normally, with 
no revision information. If there is no old value, the new value shows up as inserted. The 
following table lists the RTF specifications for these special properties. 
Control word Meaning 
\pnrauthN Index into the revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to 
be the author of that revision.  
Note This keyword is used to indicate paragraph number revisions. 
\pnrdateN Time of the revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer. 
\pnrnot Indicates whether the paragraph number for the current paragraph is marked as "inserted." 
\pnrxstN The keywords \pnrxstN, \pnrrgbN, \pnrpnbrN, and \pnrnfcN describe the "deleted number" 
text for the paragraph number. Their values are binary. Each of these keywords is represented as 
an array. The deleted number is written out with a \pnrstartN keyword, followed by the array’s 
keyword, followed by the first byte of the array, followed by the array’s keyword, followed by the 
second byte of the array’s keyword, followed by the array’s keyword, followed by the third byte of 
the array’s keyword, and so on. Some arrays contain 16-bit (32-bit) quantities, but each array 
keyword only takes a byte value, so two (four) array keywords are needed to represent a single 
quantity in these cases. This sequence is followed by the \pnrstopN keyword. 
\pnrxstN is a 32-item Unicode character array (two bytes for each character)with a length byte 
as the first number—it has the actual text of the number, with "level" place holders written out as 
digits from 0 through 8. 
\pnrrgbN Nine-item array of indices of the level place holders in the \pnrxstN array. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 88 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
\pnrnfcN Nine-item array containing the number format codes of each level (using the same values as the 
\levelnfcN keyword)The number format code is represented as a short integer.  
\pnrpnbrN Nine-item array of the actual values of the number in each level. The number is represented as a 
long integer. 
\pnrstartN The \pnrxstN, \pnrrgbN, \pnrpnbrN, and \pnrnfcN arrays are each preceded by the 
\pnrstartN keyword, whose argument is 0 through 3, respectively, depending on the array. 
\pnrstopN The \pnrxstN, \pnrrgbN, \pnrpnbrN, and \pnrnfcN arrays are each terminated by the 
\pnrstopN keyword, whose argument is the number of bytes written out in the array. 
 
Example: Let’s take an example of the number "3-4b", which represents the third level of the 
list. The following table lists the values of each array. 
Array Binary Comment 
pnrxst \'05\'00-\'01\'02. The length of the string is 5. Then, first level (level 0) followed by a dash (character 
4510), followed by the second and third levels (levels 1 and 2)followed by a period 
(character 4610). 
pnrrgb \'01\'03\'04 The level place holders are at indices 1, 3, and 4 in the string. The remaining six unused 
levels should be emitted as index 0. 
pnrnfc \'00\'00\'04 The nfc values are Arabic (0) Arabic (0)and lowercase letter (4) The remaining six 
unused nfc values should be emitted as 0. 
pnrpnbr \'03\'04\'02 The numbers, i.e., 3, 4, and 2 (b). The remaining unused number values should be 
emitted as 0.

Control word Meaning 
Frame Size 
\abswN N is the width of the frame in twips.  
\abshN N is the height of the frame in twips. A positive number indicates the minimum height of the 
frame, and a negative number indicates the exact height of the frame. A value of zero indicates 
that the height of the frame adjusts to the contents of the frame. This is the default for frames 
where no height is given. 
Horizontal Position 
\phmrg Use the margin as the horizontal reference frame. 
\phpg Use the page as the horizontal reference frame. 
\phcol Use the column as the horizontal reference frame. This is the default if no horizontal reference 
frame is given. 
\posxN Positions the frame N twips from the left edge of the reference frame. 
\posnegxN  Same as \posxN but allows arbitrary negative values.  
\posxc Centers the frame horizontally within the reference frame. 
\posxi Positions the paragraph horizontally inside the reference frame. 
\posxo Positions the paragraph horizontally outside the reference frame. 
\posxr Positions the paragraph to the right within the reference frame. 
\posxl Positions the paragraph to the left within the reference frame. This is the default if no horizontal 
positioning information is given. 
Vertical Position 
\pvmrg Positions the reference frame vertically relative to the margin. This is the default if no vertical 
frame positioning information is given. 
\pvpg Positions the reference frame vertically relative to the page. 
\pvpara Positions the reference frame vertically relative to the upper left corner of the next unframed 
paragraph in the RTF stream. 
\posyN Positions the paragraph N twips from the top edge of the reference frame. 
\posnegyN  Same as \posyN but allows arbitrary negative values. 
\posyil Positions paragraph vertically to be inline. 
\posyt Positions paragraph at the top of the reference frame. 
\posyc Centers paragraph vertically within the reference frame. 
\posyb Positions paragraph at the bottom of the reference frame. 
\posyin Positions paragraph vertically inside the reference frame. 
\posyout Positions paragraph vertically outside the reference frame. 
\abslockN Lock anchor: 
0 Do not lock anchor (default) 
1 Locks a frame anchor to the current paragraph that it is associated with. 
Text Wrapping 
\nowrap Prevents text from flowing around the positioned object. 
\dxfrtextN Distance in twips of a positioned paragraph from text in the main text flow in all directions. 
\dfrmtxtxN N is the horizontal distance in twips from text on both sides of the frame. 
\dfrmtxtyN N is the vertical distance in twips from text on both sides of the frame. 
\overlay Text flows underneath frame.  Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Paragraph Formatting

Table Definitions 
There is no RTF table group; instead, tables are specified as paragraph properties. A table is 
represented as a sequence of table rows. A table row is a contiguous series of paragraphs 
partitioned into cells. The table row begins with the \trowd control word and ends with the 
\row control word. Every paragraph that is contained in a table row must have the \intbl 
control word specified or inherited from the previous paragraph. A cell may have more than one 
paragraph in it; the cell is terminated by a cell mark (the \cell control word), and the row is 
terminated by a row mark (the \row control word). Table rows can also be positioned. In this 
case, every paragraph in a table row must have the same positioning controls (see the <apoctl> 
controls on the Positioned Objects and Frames subsection of this Specification. Table properties 
may be inherited from the previous row; therefore, a series of table rows may be introduced by 
a single <tbldef>. 
An RTF table row has the following syntax, as shown in the general paragraph-text syntax 
shown in the Paragraph Text section of this Specification: Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Tables

<row> (<tbldef> <cell>+ <tbldef> \row)| (<tbldef> <cell>+ \row)| (<cell>+ <tbldef> \row) 
<cell> (<nestrow>? <tbldef>?) & <textpar>+ \cell 
<nestrow> <nestcell>+ '{\*' \nesttableprops <tbldef> \nestrow '}' 
<nestcell> <textpar>+ \nestcell 
 
Note: While Word 97 emitted the row properties (<tbldef>) at the beginning of the row, a reader should not 
assume that this is the case. Properties can be emitted at the end, and, in fact, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 
2007 do this. To avoid breaking readers that might make the aforementioned assumption, Word 2002, Word 2003, 
and Word 2007 will write a copy at the beginning as well, so the properties of a typical row in a Word 2002, Word 
2003, or Word 2007 document are repeated at the beginning and at the end of the row. Note that for nested cells, 
Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 write the properties at the end only.

\clhidemark This control word specifies whether the end of cell glyph shall influence the height of the given 
table row in the table. If it is specified, then only printing characters in this cell shall be used to 
determine the row height. 
Note: Typically, the height of a table row is determined by the height of all glyphs in all cells in 
that row, including the non-printing end of cell glyph characters. However, if these characters are 
not formatted, they are always created with the document default style properties. This means 
that the height of a table row cannot ever be reduced below the size of the end of cell marker 
glyph without manually formatting each paragraph in that run.  
In a typical document, this behavior is desirable as it prevents table rows from ‘disappearing’ if 
they have no contentK eoweverI if a table row is being used as a border Efor exampleI by shading 
its cells or putting an image in themF then this behavior makes it impossible to have a virtual 
border that is reasonably small without formatting each cell’s content directlyK qhis setting 
specifies that the end of cell glyph shall be ignored for this cellI allowing it to collapse to the 
height of its contents without formatting each cell’s end of cell markerI which would have the side 
effect of formatting any text ever entered into that cellK  
ff this control word is omittedI then the end of cell marker shall be included in the determination 
of the height of this rowK 
bxampleW Consider the following oqc tableW 

 
kotice that the only printing content in this table row is displayed using R point fontI yet the row 
height is influenced by the end of cell markers in the empty cellsK

Example 
The following is an example of a complex Word 2000 table created from RTF. It does not take 
account of the table styles implemented in Word 2002, Word 2003, or Word 2007. The bitmap 
showing the table’s formatting is followed by the actual RTF used to create it. Following this 
example display of RTF is an analysis of the control words and values used to create the table. 
The image shows a freely positioned Word table, with two cells at an offset. Inside the topmost 
cell is a nested table. The table has green borders, yellow shading, a small amount of spacing 
between cells, and inner cell margins or padding. 
 

 
 
The following RTF was emitted by Word 2000. Word 2000 also emits RTF that older readers 
(such as previous versions of Word) can understand, so new features degrade nicely.

End of nested table properties 
 
Set the default for the row again after nested table! We’re still in the first row, and this repeats 
what was written in the beginning of the row. Defaults of the table are reset and the cell is closed 
with a \cell.

Table Styles Example 

 
Here is the style sheet with one table style highlighted. Note that a single table style can have 
multiple entries.  
\ts11 is the default table style. This style gives the first row a fill color and font attributes. 
Every subsequent odd row is filled with pale yellow.

Mathematics 
This section discusses the Microsoft Office Word 2007 math RTF control words. These control 
words mirror the Office Open XML Math elements (OMML, see Office Open XML, Section 7.1), 
only they are written with RTF syntax. Because of this, the Office Open XML specification can be 
referenced for further math information. For example in OMML, the built-up skewed fraction ߃߄ෝ 
can be represented by (leaving out parent math zone elements): 
<m:f>  
<m:fPr> 
    <m:type m:val="skw"/> 
</m:fPr> 
<m:num> 
      <m:r>a</m:r> 
</m:num> 
<m:den> 
      <m:r>b</m:r> 
</m:den> 
</m:f> 
 
In RTF, this can be represented as: 
{\mf{\mfPr{\mctrlPr}{\mtype skw}} 
{\mnum\u-10187?\u-9138?} 
{\mden\u-10187?\u-9137?}} 
 
The math object’s properties group must be included, here {\mfPr…}, including the {\mctrlPr} 
even if the latter is empty if you want the text to inherit ambient character formatting.  
Word generally does not write surrogate pairs for Unicode math alphanumerics like ߃ and ߄, but 
they work and they’re simpler to use since they’re used internally for most math variables. 
Instead, Word writes {\mr\mscr0\msty2 a} for the math italic a (U+1D44E) in the numerator of 
the fraction above and {\mr\mscr0\msty2 b} for the math italic b (U+1D44F) in the 
denominator. Surrogate pairs like \u-10187?\u-9138? must appear inside math object groups 
as in this example, or inside a math text-run group {\mr…} if not inside a math object.  
Math information is collected into two areas:  
1. Document default math properties in the {\mmathPr…} group 
2. Math zones in {\mmath…} groups 
A math zone is a text range within which math typography rules usually apply and outside of 
which math typography rules do not apply. Math zones can contain specially marked normal text Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Mathematics

runs for which math typography rules don’t apply (see \mnor). With Office math, math zones 
are identified internally by a character-format effect bit like bold. Hence if you delete the 
ordinary text separating two math zones, you get a single merged math zone. 
Math zones can be inline or display, corresponding to TeX’s $ and $$ toggle keys. If a math zone 
fills an entire paragraph, it is a display math zone, i.e., it is displayed on its own line(s). If a 
math zone is preceded and/or followed by nonmath text other than a \par, the math zone is 
inline and is rendered in a more compressed fashion. Inline math zones usually consist of math 
expressions or variables, whereas display math zones usually consist of one or more equations 
or formulas. 
The RTF for the content of an inline math zone replaces the first ellipsis of the nested group 
structure 
{\mmath {\*\moMath…}{\mmathPict…}} 
Readers that do not understand the ignorable {\*\moMath…} group can use one of the pictures 
in the {\mmathPict…} group.  
The RTF for the content of a display math zone replaces the second ellipsis in the nested group 
structure 
{\mmath{\*\moMathPara{\moMathParaPr…}{\*\moMath…}+}{\mmathPict…}} 
Here the + means that a {\*\moMath…} group is emitted for each instance of mathematical text 
that should start on a new line, e.g., for each new equation. The control word \moMathPara 
stands for a “math paragraph”, which can contain multiple equations with various alignment and 
breaking options. A math paragraph may be part of a text paragraph (text ending in a \par and 
either starting a document or following a \par). In general, a text paragraph can contain 
multiple math paragraphs separated from one another by lines of normal text. 
In this discussion, we see that math RTF uses two ways to assign property values depending on 
the property: 1) the standard RTF way with a parameter N as in \msty2, and 2) using a mini 
group like {\mtype skw}. The latter way is inspired from the corresponding OMML syntax, such 
as <m:type m:val="skw"/>, while the RTF way is more succinct. As usual in this document, 
control words that take a parameter N are displayed with a trailing N in the following detailed 
definitions. 
Syntax 
The math RTF document properties group has the following syntax: 
<mathprops> '{\*' \mmathPr <mathPr>* '}'

Math RTF Control Words 
Here is an alphabetical listing of all RTF math control words (to obtain the corresponding Office 
Open XML  tag, delete the leading “\m”): 
Control word Meaning 
\macc Accent object, consisting of a base and a combining diacritical mark. 
\maccPr Accent object properties group 
\maln Alignment property on box object, utilized only when box is designated as an operator 
emulator. When true, this operator emulator serves as an alignment point; that is, 
designated alignment points in other equations can be aligned with it. 
\malnScr Alignment of scripts in subscript/superscript object. When on (resulting from {\malnScr 
on})subscripts and superscripts are aligned to each other. When off, they are kerned to 
the shape of the base. If this control word is omitted, scripts are not aligned.  
Example: (off) ߈஼஼ (on) ߈஼஼ 
\margPr Math argument properties group 
\margSz Size, or script level, of an argument. For example, {\margSz 1} requests the next 
larger size (next smaller script level)Only text, script, and scriptscript sizes are 
available. This appears in the subscript object ߃Ϲ in contrast to the usual ߃஻. 
\mbar Bar object, consisting of a base argument and an overbar or underbar as in ߃෋߄ 
and ߃෋߄, depending on the \mpos property. 
\mbarPr Bar object properties group 
\mbaseJc Vertical justification of a matrix. 
Text outside the matrix can be aligned with the bottom, top, or center of a matrix 
function. If this control word is omitted, the matrix assumes center justification.  
Example: 
This matrix has {\mbaseJc center}: ෳ
ϹϺ
ϻϼ

{\mbegChr \{}{\mendChr \}}. 
\mborderBox Border Box object, consisting of a border drawn around an equation 
\mborderBoxPr Border Box object properties group; specifies the properties of the \mborderBox object, 
which dictate the types of lines that can be drawn as part of the border.  
Example: ߃஼෋߄஼ි߅஼ (Êïçíõôçò Ùúøïñëúîøõûíî ìøõó Ûööëø òëìú) 
çôê 
 ߃஼෋߄஼ි߅஼ (ôõ òëìú õø øïíîú ëêíëù) 
\mbox Box object, used to group components of an equation. 
\mboxPr Box object properties group; specifies properties of the \mbox function, for example, 
whether the \mbox serves as operator emulator with or without an alignment point, 
serves as a line breakpoint, or receives the correct spacing for the mathematical 
differential. 
\mbrkN Specifies whether a line break occurs in a display math zone at start of \mbox or \mr 
object such that the line wraps at the start of the run or function. If this control word is 
omitted, a manual break is not inserted. The line may happen to wrap at this point if the 
equation exceeds the column width. The break aligns to the (N + 1)st operator on the 
first line of the math zone. 
Example: The following example has a manual line break \mbrk1 for the run containing

\mbrkBinN Document property specifying how binary operators are treated when they coincide with 
a line break. 
If this control word is omitted or N = 0, the line break occurs before the binary operator. 
That is, the binary operator is the first control word on the wrapped line. If N = 1, the 
line break occurs after the operator. If N = 2, the operator is duplicated, that is, it 
appears at the end of the first line and at the start of the second (see \mbrkBinSubN 
for an enhancement of this kind of break)

\mvertJc Along with \mpos of \mgroupChrPr, specifies the vertical layout of the \mgroupChr 
object. Where \mpos specifies the position of the grouping character, \mvertJc 
specifies the alignment of the object with respect to the baseline.  
For example, when the group character is above the object, \mvertJc of top signifies 
that the top of the object falls on the baseline; when \mvertJc is set to bot, the bottom 
of the object is on the baseline. The table below demonstrates the four possible 
combinations of \mgroupChr layout:

To read negative \expndN values from Macintosh Word 5.1 (1992) and earlier, an RTF reader 
should use only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. These versions do not emit negative 
values for \expndN. Instead, they treat values from 57 through 63 as –7 through –1, 
respectively (the low-order 6 bits of 57 through 63 are the same as –7 through –1). MacWord 
6.0 on was based on the Word for Windows and interprets \expndN the same way.  
Character Borders and Shading 
Character shading has the following syntax: 
<chshading> (\chshdngN | <pat>)\chcfpatN? \chcbpatN? 
<pat> \chbghoriz | \chbgvert | \chbgfdiag | \chbgbdiag | \chbgcross | \chbgdcross | 
\chbgdkhoriz | \chbgdkvert | \chbgdkfdiag | \chbgdkbdiag | \chbgdkcross | 
\chbgdkdcross  
 
Control word Meaning 
\chbrdr Character border (border always appears on all sides) 
\chshdngN Character shading. The N argument is a value representing the shading of the text in hundredths 
of a percent. 
\chcfpatN N is the pattern background color index.  
\chcbpatN N is the pattern foreground color index. 
\chbghoriz Specifies horizontal background pattern for the text. 
\chbgvert Specifies vertical background pattern for the text. 
\chbgfdiag Specifies forward diagonal background pattern for the text (\\\\) 
\chbgbdiag Specifies backward diagonal background pattern for the text (////) 
\chbgcross Specifies cross background pattern for the text. 
\chbgdcross Specifies diagonal cross background pattern for the text. 
\chbgdkhoriz Specifies dark horizontal background pattern for the text. 
\chbgdkvert Specifies dark vertical background pattern for the text. 
\chbgdkfdiag Specifies dark forward diagonal background pattern for the text (\\\\) 
\chbgdkbdiag Specifies dark backward diagonal background pattern for the text (////) 
\chbgdkcross Specifies dark cross background pattern for the text. 
\chbgdkdcross Specifies dark diagonal cross background pattern for the text.

Character Revision Mark Properties 
These properties have the syntax and control words defined by 
<chrev> \revised? \revauthN? \revdttmN? \crauthN? \crdateN? \deleted? \revauthdelN? 
\revdttmdelN? \mvf? \mvt? \mvauthN? \mvdateN? 
 
Control word Meaning 
Track Changes (Revision Mark)Properties 
\deleted Text has been deleted since revision marking was turned on. 
\revised Text has been added since revision marking was turned on. 
\crauthN Index into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that revision.  
Note This keyword is used to indicate formatting revisions, such as bold, italic.  
\crdateN Time of revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer. 
\revauthN Index into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that revision. 
\revdttmN Time of revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer. 
\revauthdelN Index into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that deletion.  
\revdttmdelN Time of deletion. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer. 
\mvf Text has been moved to another location (is part of a “Move From”) since revision marking was 
turned on. This is only valid inside a “Move From” bookmark (see \mvfmf and \mvfml)  
Note: Deletion keywords (\deleted, \revauthdelN) are emitted as well so that move-unaware 
applications can understand the revision as a deletion. These keywords can be ignored by move-
aware applications.  
\mvt Text has been moved from another location (is part of a “Move To”) since revision marking was 
turned on. This is only valid inside a “Move To” bookmark (see \mvtof and \mvtol) 
Note: Insertion keywords (\revised, \revauthN) are emitted as well so that move-unaware 
applications can understand the revision as an insertion. These auxiliary keywords can be ignored 
by move-aware applications. 
\mvauthN Index into revision table. The contents of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that move. 
\mvdateN Time of move. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer. 
 
Associated Character Properties 
Bidirectional-aware text processors often need to associate a Latin (or other left-to-right) font 
with an Arabic or Hebrew (or other right-to-left)font. The association is needed to match 
commonly used pairs of fonts in name, size, and other attributes. Although RTF defines a broad 
variety of associated character properties, any implementation may choose not to implement a 
particular associated character property and share the property between the Latin and Arabic 
fonts.  
South Asian (complex script) runs of text share associated properties with right-to-left runs, but 
they are considered left-to-right.  
Property association uses the following syntax:

The following are some examples of property association. The first example is a right-to-left run. 
Text will use the default bidirectional font, and will be underlined. The left-to-right font 
associated with this run is font 2 (in the font table) with bold and underlining. 
\ltrch\af2\ab\au\rtlch\u Sample Text 
The next example is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font and the left-to-right font use the 
default font (specified by \deffN) 
\plain\rtlch\ltrch Sample Text  
The following example is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font is font 5, bold and italic. The 
left-to-right font is the default font, underlined. If the reader does not support underlining in the 
associated font, both fonts will be underlined. 
\rtlch\af5\ab\ai\ltrch\u Sample Text 
The property association control words (described as <aprops> in the syntax description) are 
listed in the following table. Some control words (indicated in the table by an asterisk following 
the description) can be turned off by appending 0 to the control word. 
Control word Meaning 
\ab* Associated font is bold. 
\acaps* Associated font is all capitals. 
\acfN Associated foreground color (default is 0)

Highlighting 
This property applies highlighting to text. The formatting is not a character format, so it cannot 
be part of a style definition. 
Control word Meaning 
\highlightN Highlights the specified text. N specifies the color as an index of the color table. 
  
Special Characters 
The RTF Specification includes control words for special characters (described as <spec> in the 
character-text syntax description). If a special-character control word is not recognized by the 
RTF reader, it is ignored and the text following it is considered plain text. The RTF Specification 
is flexible enough to allow new special characters to be added for interchange with other 
software. 
The special RTF characters are listed in the following table (<spec> is any one of these). 
Control word Meaning 
\chdate Current date (as in headers) 
\chdpl Current date in long format (for example, Wednesday, February 20, 2008)

\zwj Zero-width joiner. This is used for ligating (joining) characters. 
\zwnj Zero-width nonjoiner. This is used for unligating a character.  
 
A carriage return (character value 13) or line feed (character value 10) is treated as a \par 
control if the character is preceded by a backslash. You must include the backslash; otherwise, 
RTF ignores the control word. (You may also want to insert a carriage-return/line feed pair 
without backslashes at least every 255 characters for better text transmission over 
communication lines.) 
A tab (character value 9) should be treated as a \tab control word. Not all RTF readers 
understand this; therefore, an RTF writer should always emit the control word for tabs. 
The following are the code values for the special characters listed.

Document Variables 
Document variables are definable and accessed through macros. Document variables have the 
following syntax: 
<variables> '{\*' \docvar '{' <varname> '}{' <vartext> '}}' 
<varname> #PCDATA 
<vartext> #PCDATA 
 
The control word is described in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\ docvar A group that defines a document variable name and its value. 
Bookmarks 
This destination may specify one of two control words: \*\bkmkstart, which indicates the start 
of the specified bookmark, and \*\bkmkend, which indicates the end of the specified 
bookmark. 
Bookmarks have the following syntax: 
<bookmark> <bookstart> | <bookend> 
<bookstart> '{\*' \bkmkstart (\bkmkcolfN? & \bkmkcollN?)#PCDATA '}' 
<bookend> '{\*' \bkmkend #PCDATA '}' 
 
A bookmark is shown in the following example: 
\pard\plain \fs20 Kuhn believes that science, rather than  
discovering in experience certain structured  
relationships, actually creates (or already participates in) 
a presupposed structure to which it fits the data.  
{\bkmkstart paradigm} Kuhn calls such a presupposed  
structure a paradigm.{\bkmkend paradigm} 
The bookmark start and end are matched with the bookmark tag. In this example, the 
bookmark tag is “paradigm”. Each bookmark start should have a matching bookmark end; 
however, the bookmark start and the bookmark end may be in any order. 
\bkmkcolfN is used to denote the first column of a table covered by a bookmark. If it is not 
included, the first column is assumed. \bkmkcollN is used to denote the last column. If it is not 
used, the last column is assumed. These controls are used within the \*\bkmkstart 
destination following the \bkmkstart control. For example, {\*\bkmkstart\bkmkcolf2\bkmkcoll5 
Table1} places the bookmark “Table1” in columns 2 through 5 of a table. 
Move Bookmarks 
Move bookmarks provide an additional mechanism for revision tracking and behave in a similar, 
but more complex, fashion with respect to insertions (\revised) and deletions (\deleted) 
Specifically, unlike insertions and deletions, which only use character properties to mark a text 
run as inserted or deleted, move bookmarks use a combination of character properties and Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Character Formatting

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
bookmarks. Character properties are used in the same way as in insertions and deletions – text 
is just marked to indicate that it has been moved. 
Bookmarks, on the other hand, are used to signify where within the document the move is. This 
is needed because moved text may be edited; newly inserted or deleted2 text, although within a 
move location, does not have the character properties for a move as it was not part of the 
original move. Newly typed text, for example, will either be marked through its character 
properties as an insertion (if you have “Track Changes” enabled) or not at all (if changes are not 
being tracked). 
In short, bookmarks are used to determine where the move location is, and character properties 
are used to mark specific text runs as being part of the move. 
Move bookmarks are just two different kinds of bookmarks indicating the source and the 
destination of a move, respectively. The move’s source and destination bookmarks are matched 
by their unique tag (the same one that is used for matching the start and the end of the 
bookmark), and also contain move-specific information describing the author and date of a 
move. 
\*\mvfmf and \*\mvtof signify the start of a “Move From” or “Move To” bookmark, 
respectively. They indicate the move bookmark’s unique tag3 and a hex-encoded structure 
describing the author and date/time of the revision. 
\*\mvfml and \*\mvtol signify the end of a “Move From” or “Move To” bookmark, 
respectively. They indicate the move bookmark’s unique tag so that they can be matched to 
their corresponding bookmark start control words. 
Move bookmark syntax is: 
<movebook> <movebookstart> | <movebookend> 
<movebookstart> '{\*' (\mvfmf | \mvtof) #PCDATA #SDATA '}' 
<movebookend> '{\*' (\mvfml | \mvtol) #PCDATA '}' 
 
As with normal bookmarks, the #PCDATA represents a unique tag for matching the start and the 
end of a bookmark, and, in moves, the source and destination locations. #SDATA represents a 
6-byte structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthN control word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure). 
The following is a sample of move tracking within an RTF file: 
{\*\mvfmf move148856603 0100768baa46} <Move source’s contents> {\*\mvfml move148856603} 
{\*\mvtof move148856603 0100768baa46} <Move destination’s contents> {\*\mvtol move148856603} 
 
                                                        
2 Text can be deleted from a “Move To” location. 
3 Word generates “moveN”, where N is a unique number, but any alphanumeric string not longer than twenty characters 
is valid. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Character Formatting

Control word Meaning 
\*\mvfmf Signifies the start of a “Move From” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding end of the “Move From” bookmark (ymvfml) the document and 
with the corresponding “Move To” bookmark (\mvtof and \mvtol) 
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word: 
 If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvfml control word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move From” bookmark exists. 
 If this control word and its corresponding bookmark end control word (\mvfml)occur 
without a matching “Move To” bookmark (\mvtof and \mvtol)then moved content in 
this move location shall be treated as if it has been marked as deleted instead of moved. 
The control word and the bookmark tag are followed by the binary representation of a 6-byte 
structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthN control word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure) 
For example, in the RTF fragment below, 0100768baa46 specifies 0x0001 for the author and 
0x46aa8b76 for the date/time, which corresponds to Tue 2006-10-17 13:54) 
{\*\mvfmf move148856603 0100768baa46}  
\*\mvfml Signifies the end of a “Move From” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding start of the “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf )in the document and 
with the corresponding “Move To” bookmark (\mvtof and \mvtol) 
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word: 
 If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvfmf control word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move From” bookmark exists. 
 If this control word and its corresponding bookmark start control word occur without a 
matching “Move To” bookmark E\mvtof and \mvtol), then moved content in this move 
location shall be treated as if it has been deleted instead of moved. 
\*\mvtof Signifies the start of the “Move To” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding end of the “Move To” bookmark (\mvtol) in the document and with 
the corresponding “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf and \mvfml) 
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word 
 If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvtol control word with a matching 
tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move To” bookmark exists. 
 If this control word and its corresponding bookmark end control word occur without a 
matching “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf and \mvfml) then moved content in this 
move location shall be treated as if it has been marked as inserted instead of moved. 
The control word and the bookmark tag are followed by the binary representation of a 6-byte 
structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthN control word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure) 
For example, in the RTF fragment below, 0100768baa46 specifies 0x0001 for the author and 
0x46aa8b76 for the date/time, which corresponds to Tue 2006-10-17 13:54) 
{\*\mvtof move148856603 0100768baa46} 
\*\mvtol Signifies the end of a “Move To” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control word 
with the corresponding start of the “Move To” bookmark E\mvtof) in the document and with the 
corresponding “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf and \mvfml) 
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word: 
 If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvtof control word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move To” bookmark exists. 
 If this control word and its corresponding bookmark start control word occur without a 
matching “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf and \mvfml) then moved content in this 
move location shall be treated as if it has been inserted instead of moved.

Pictures 
An RTF file can include pictures created with other applications. These pictures can be in 
hexadecimal (the default) or binary format. Pictures are destinations and begin with the \pict 
control word. The \pict keyword is preceded by the \*\shppict destination control keyword as 
described in the following example. A picture destination has the following syntax: 
<pict> '{' \pict (<pictdata> | <shpdata>) '}' 
<pictdata> (<brdr>? & <shading>? & <picttype> & <pictsize> & <metafileinfo>?) <data> 
<picttype> \emfblip | \pngblip | \jpegblip | \macpict | \pmmetafileN | \wmetafileN | 
\dibitmapN <bitmapinfo> | \wbitmapN <bitmapinfo> 
<bitmapinfo> \wbmbitspixel & \wbmplanes & \wbmwidthbytes 
<pictsize> (\picwN & \pichN) \picwgoal? & \pichgoal? \picscalex? & \picscaley? & \picscaled? & 
\piccropt? & \piccropb? & \piccropr? & \piccropl? 
<metafileinfo> \picbmp & \picbppN 
<data> (\binN #BDATA)| #SDATA 
<shpdata> '{\*' \picprop \shplidN? <shpprop>+ '}' 
<shpprop> '{' \sp '{' \sn <shpname> '}{' \sv <shpvalue> '}}' 
<shpname> #PCDATA 
<shpvalue> #BDATA 
 
These control words are described in the following table. Some measurements in this table are

Control word Meaning  
\emfblip Source of the picture is an EMF (enhanced metafile). 
\pngblip Source of the picture is a PNG. 
\jpegblip Source of the picture is a JPEG. 
\shppict Specifies a Word 97 through Word 2002 picture. This is a destination control word. 
\nonshppict Specifies that Word 97 through Word 2002 has written a {\pict destination that it will not read on 
input. This keyword is for compatibility with other readers. 
\macpict Source of the picture is QuickDraw. 
\pmmetafileN Source of the picture is an OS/2 metafile. The N argument identifies the metafile type. The N 
values are described in the \pmmetafileN table further on in this section. 
\wmetafileN Source of the picture is a Windows metafile. The N argument identifies the metafile mapping 
mode (the default type is 1, which is MM_TEXT) 
\dibitmapN Source of the picture is a Windows device-independent bitmap. The N argument identifies the 
bitmap type, which must equal 0. 
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-independent bitmap is the 
concatenation of the BITMAPINFO structure followed by the actual pixel data. 
\wbitmapN Source of the picture is a Windows device-dependent bitmap. The N argument identifies the 
bitmap type (must equal 0) 
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-dependent bitmap is the result of 
the GetBitmapBits function. 
 
The following is an example of the \shppict group: 
{\*\shppict {\pict \emfblip …}}{\nonshppict {\pict …}} 
For best device-independence and interoperability with Microsoft products, use of the 
\wbitmapN and \dibitmapN control words is discouraged. Rather, bitmaps should be 
embedded within Windows metafiles and the \wmetafileN control word should be used. For 
more information on the GetDIBits and GetBitmapBits functions, the structure of Windows 
device-independent and device-dependent bitmaps, and information on embedding bitmaps 
within metafiles, see The GDI Bitmap Reference section in MSDN. The following table outlines 
picture control keywords: 
Control word Meaning 
Bitmap Information 
\wbmbitspixelN Number of adjacent color bits on each plane needed to define a pixel. Possible values are 1 
(monochrome), 4 (16 colors) 8 (256 colors) and 24 (RGB) The default value is 1. 
\wbmplanesN Number of bitmap color planes (must equal 1) 
\wbmwidthbytesN Specifies the number of bytes in each raster line. This value must be an even number because 
the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) assumes that the bit values of a bitmap form an 
array of integer (two-byte) values. In other words, \wbmwidthbytes multiplied by 8 must be 
the next multiple of 16 greater than or equal to the \picw (bitmap width in pixels) value. 
Picture Size, Scaling, and Cropping 
\picwN xExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture width in pixels if the picture is a bitmap 
or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer. 
\pichN yExt field if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture height in pixels if the picture is a bitmap 
or from QuickDraw. The N argument is a long integer. 
\picwgoalN Desired width of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer. 
\pichgoalN Desired height of the picture in twips. The N argument is a long integer. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Pictures and Objects

Control word Meaning 
\picscalexN Horizontal scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage (default is 100 
percent) 
\picscaleyN Vertical scaling value. The N argument is a value representing a percentage (default is 100 
percent) 
\picscaled Scales the picture to fit within the specified frame. Used only with \macpict pictures. 
\picprop Indicates there are shape properties applied to an inline picture. This is a destination control 
word. 
\defshp Indicates that the inline picture is a WordArt shape. 
\piccroptN Top cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative 
value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value 
is 0) 
\piccropbN Bottom cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a 
negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the 
default value is 0) 
\piccroplN Left cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative 
value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value 
is 0) 
\piccroprN Right cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a 
negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the 
default value is 0) 
Metafile Information 
\picbmp Specifies whether a metafile contains a bitmap. 
\picbppN Specifies the bits per pixel in a metafile bitmap. The valid range is 1 through 32, with 1, 4, 8, 
and 24 being recognized. 
Picture Data 
\binN The picture is in binary format. The numeric parameter N is the number of bytes that follow. 
Unlike most other control words, \binN takes a 32-bit parameter and the bytes are any 8-bit 
values. 
\blipupiN N represents units per inch on a picture (only certain image types need or output this) 
\blipuid Destination of the form '{\*' \blipuid XXXX '}' where XXXX is a 16-byte identification number 
for the image. 
\bliptagN A unique identifier for a picture, where N is a 32-bit signed integer value. 
 
The \wbitmapN control word is optional. If no other picture type is specified, the picture is 
assumed to be a Windows bitmap. If \wmetafileN is specified, the N argument can be one of 
the following Windows mapping modes: 
Type N argument 
MM_TEXT 1 
MM_LOMETRIC 2 
MM_HIMETRIC 3 
MM_LOENGLISH 4 
MM_HIENGLISH 5 
MM_TWIPS 6 
MM_ISOTROPIC 7 
MM_ANISOTROPIC 8

If \pmmetafileN is specified, the N argument can be one of the following types. 
Type N argument 
PU_ARBITRARY 0x0004 
PU_PELS 0x0008 
PU_LOMETRIC 0x000C 
PU_HIMETRIC 0x0010 
PU_LOENGLISH 0x0014 
PU_HIENGLISH 0x0018 
PU_TWIPS 0x001C 
 
Be careful with spaces following control words when dealing with pictures in binary format. 
When reading files, RTF considers the first space after a control word to be the delimiter and 
subsequent spaces part of the document text. Therefore, any extra spaces are attached to the 
picture, with unpredictable results. 
RTF writers should not use the carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) combination to break up 
pictures in binary format. If they do, the CR/LF combination is treated as literal text and 
considered part of the picture data. 
The picture in hexadecimal or binary format follows the picture-destination control words. The 
following example illustrates the destination format: 
{\pict\wbitmap0\picw170\pich77\wbmbitspixel1\wbmplanes1\wbmwidthbytes22

Custom XML Tags 
Custom XML Tags and Smart Tags provide a facility for embedding customer-defined semantics 
into the document by using the ability to provide a basic namespace or name for a run or set of 
runs in a document. For example, an invoice document may wish to specify that a particular 
sentence of text is a customer name, in order for that information to be easily extracted from 
the document without the need to parse the text using regular expression matching or similar Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Pictures and Objects

technique. For such scenarios, multiple facilities are provided for the insertion and round-
tripping of customer defined semantics within a document. RTF supports two distinct forms in 
which customer-defined semantics can be inserted into a document, each with its own specific 
intended usage: 
 Smart tags, which provide a basic namespace/name for a run or set of runs within a 
document 
 Custom XML markup, which provides the ability to tag the document with XML 
elements and attributes specified by any valid XML Schema file. 
 
The following table lists the keywords that have been added to convert Custom XML Tags data 
to RTF.

additional information on custom XML parts, please reference the Office Open XML section on 
the element “datastoreItem”.  Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Pictures and Objects

On Windows, custom XML parts may be saved to RTF as follows: The custom xml parts are 
written to an IStorage interface that is then stamped with the following CLSID: 
CLSID_SAXXMLReader50. The system call OleConvertIStorageToOLESTREAM is then used to 
flatten the IStorage that is then hex-encoded and written to the RTF stream. On other 
platforms, the custom data would be "flattened" using equivalent system functions. The format 
of the flattened data is unknown to RTF. Please refer to the documentation for the custom XML 
parts involved for definitions of the flattened data. 
Custom XML parts can be loaded from RTF by decoding them and then using the 
OleConvertOLESTREAMToIStorage system call to convert the flattened stream in RTF to an 
IStorage.  
The syntax of Custom XML Data Properties is: 
<datastore> '{\*' \datastore #SDATA '}' 
Objects 
Microsoft OLE links, Microsoft OLE embedded objects, and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber 
objects are represented in RTF as objects. Objects are destinations that contain data and a 
result. The data is generally hidden to the application that produced the document. A separate 
application uses the data and supplies the appearance of the data. This appearance is the result 
of the object. 
The representation of objects in RTF is designed to allow RTF readers that do not understand 
objects, or do not use a particular type of object, to use the current result in place of the object. 
This allows the appearance of the object to be maintained through the conversion even though 
the object functionality is lost. Each object comes with optional information about itself, a 
required destination that contains the object data, and an optional result that contains the 
current appearance of the object. This result contains standard RTF. The RTF writer is 
responsible for providing the result so that existing RTF readers that do not support objects, or 
do not support a particular type of object, are able to display the object. 
When the object is an OLE embedded or linked object, the data part of the object is the 
structure produced by the OLESaveToStream function. Some OLE clients rely on the OLE 
system to render the object when a copy of the result is not available to the RTF writer for that 
application. In these cases, the object result can be extracted from the structure produced by 
the OLESaveToStream function. For information about the OLESaveToStream function, see 
the Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding Software Development Kit. 
This destination has the following syntax:

Object Information 
\linkself The object is a link to another part of the same document. 
\objlock Locks the object from any updates. 
\objupdate Forces an update to the object before displaying it. Note that this will override any values in the 
<objsize> control words, but values should always be provided for these to maintain backward 
compatibility. 
\objclass The text argument is the object class to use for this object; ignore the class specified in the 
object data. This is a destination control word. 
\objname The text argument is the name of this object. This is a destination control word. 
\objtime Lists the time that the object was last updated. 
Object Size, Position, Cropping, and Scaling 
\objhN N is the original object height in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation. 
\objwN N is the original object width in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation. 
\objsetsize Forces the object server to set the object’s dimensions to the size specified by the client. 
\objalignN N is the distance in twips from the left edge of the objects that should be aligned on a tab stop. 
This is needed to place Equation Editor equations correctly. 
\objtransyN N is the distance in twips the objects should be moved vertically with respect to the baseline. 
This is needed to place Math Type equations correctly. 
\objcroptN N is the top cropping value in twips. 
\objcropbN N is the bottom cropping value in twips. 
\objcroplN N is the left cropping value in twips. 
\objcroprN N is the right cropping value in twips. 
\objscalexN N is the horizontal scaling percentage. 
\objscaleyN N is the vertical scaling percentage. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Pictures and Objects

Control word Meaning 
Object Class ID 
\oleclsid  This sub-destination contains the CLSID for an object for which no server is registered on the 
computer saving the given RTF file.  
When reading an RTF file, if this destination is present, then readers should know to save the 
CLSID specified by the destination’s argument, and stamp the next object that comes in the oqc 
stream with the specified CipfaK  
then writing an oqc fileI this destination may be instantiated for objects for which no server is 
registered. This destination’s argument shall be constructed as follows: 
NK Take the object’s original Cipfa 
OK Write the CLSID as the argument for \oleclsid  
3. Stamp the object with CLSID_SAXXMLReader50 
4. Write the object in the \objdata destination 
Note: If a reader ignores this destination but uses the corresponding \objdata destination, then 
it will end up with an object that believes it is a SAX XML Reader 5.0 object, even though it may 
be something else. 
Object Data 
\objdata This sub-destination contains the data for the object in the appropriate format; OLE objects are in 
OLESaveToStream format. This is a destination control word. 
\objalias This sub-destination contains the alias record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition 
Manager. This is a destination control word. 
\objsect This sub-destination contains the section record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition 
Manager. This is a destination control word. 
Object Result 
\rsltrtf Forces the result to be RTF, if possible. 
\rsltpict Forces the result to be a Windows metafile or MacPict image format, if possible. 
\rsltbmp Forces the result to be a bitmap, if possible. 
\rslttxt Forces the result to be plain text, if possible. 
\rslthtml Forces the result to be HTML, if possible. 
\rsltmerge Uses the formatting of the current result whenever a new result is obtained. 
\result The result destination is optional in the \object destination. The result destination contains the 
last update of the result of the object. The data of the result destination should be standard RTF. 
This allows RTF readers that do not understand objects or the type of object represented to use 
the current result, in place of the object, to maintain appearance. This is a destination control 
word. 
 
When Word or RichEdit is used as an editor for e-mail, the following control word can be 
emitted. Otherwise, it is not seen. 
Control word Meaning 
\objattph Object attachment placeholder. Used in the RTF stream when Word or RichEdit is used as an  
e-mail editor and the message contains attachments. The control word marks where in the 
text stream the next attachment should appear. It does not define the actual attachment. 
Following the control word, a space (\'20)is inserted to act as a placeholder for the 
attachment.

Macintosh Edition Manager Publisher Objects 
Word for the Macintosh writes publisher objects for the Macintosh Edition Manager in terms of 
bookmarks (see the Bookmark section of this specification). The range of publisher objects are 
marked as bookmarks, so these controls are all used within the \bkmkstart destination. The 
RTF syntax for a publisher object is: 
<pubobject> '{\*' \bkmkstart \bkmkpub \pubauto? (<objalias>? & <objsect>)#PCDATA '}' 
 
These control words are described in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\bkmkpub The bookmark identifies a Macintosh Edition Manager publisher object. 
\pubauto The publisher object updates all Macintosh Edition Manager subscribers of this object 
automatically, whenever it is edited.

The first destination (\shp) is always present. This control word groups everything related to a 
shape together. Following the destination change is basic information regarding the shape. The 
following keywords with values can appear in any order after the “{\shp” control word. 
 
Control word Meaning 
Shape Keywords 
\shpleftN Specifies position of shape from the left of the anchor. The value N is in twips. 
\shptopN Specifies position of shape from the top of the anchor. The value N is in twips. 
\shpbottomN Specifies position of shape from the bottom of the anchor. The value N is in twips. 
\shprightN Specifies position of shape from the right of the anchor. The value N is in twips. 
\shplidN A number that is unique to each shape. This keyword is primarily used for linked text boxes. The 
value N is a long integer. 
\shpzN Describes the z-order of the shape. It starts at 0 for the shape that is furthest from the top, and 
proceeds to the top most shape (N) The shapes that appear inside the header document will 
have a separate z-order, compared to the z-order of the shapes in the main document. For 
instance, both the back-most shape in the header and the back-most main-document shape will 
have a z-order of 0. 
\shpfhdrN Set to 0 if the shape is in the main document. Set to 1 if the shape is in the header document. 
\shpbxpage  The shape is positioned relative to the page in the x (horizontal)direction.  
\shpbxmargin  The shape is positioned relative to the margin in the x (horizontal)direction. 
\shpbxcolumn The shape is positioned relative to the column in the x (horizontal)direction. 
\shpbxignore Ignore \shpbxpage, \shpbxmargin, and \shpbxcolumn, in favor of the posrelh property. The 
ignored properties will be written for backward compatibility with older readers that do not 
understand \posrelh. 
\shpbypage  The shape is positioned relative to the page in the y (vertical)direction. 
\shpbymargin  The shape is positioned relative to the margin in the y (vertical)direction. 
\shpbypara The shape is positioned relative to the paragraph in the y (vertical) direction. 
\shpbyignore Ignore \shpbypage, \shpbymargin, and \shpbxpara, in favor of the posrelh property. The 
ignored properties will be written for backward compatibility with older readers that do not 
understand the posrelh property. 
\shpwrN Describes the type of wrap for the shape: 
1 Wrap around top and bottom of shape (no text allowed beside shape) 
2 Wrap around shape 
3 None (wrap as if shape isn’t present) 
4 Wrap tightly around shape 
5 Wrap text through shape 
\shpwrkN Wrap on side (for types 2 and 4 for \shpwrN ) 
0 Wrap both sides of shape 
1 Wrap left side only 
2 Wrap right side only 
3 Wrap only on largest side Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Shapes

Control word Meaning 
\shpfblwtxtN Describes relative z-ordering: 
0 Text is below shape 
1 Shape is below text 
\shplockanchor Lock anchor for a shape. 
\shptxt Text for a shape. The text must follow all of the other properties for the shape (inside the 
\shpinst destination)and must appear in the following format: 
{\shptxt Any valid RTF for the current text box } 
Note For linked text boxes, the first text box of the linked set has the entire story, so all 
following text boxes will not have a \shptxt field. 
\shpinst Shape instruction destination containing the shape description 
\shprslt This is where the Word 6.0 and Word 95 drawn object RTF can be placed.  
\shpgrp Specifies a group shape. The parameters following this keyword are the same as those following 
\shp. The order of the shapes inside a group is from bottom to top in z-order.  
Inside a \shpgrp, no {\shprslt …} fields would be generated Ethat isI only the root-level shape 
can have a \shprslt field (this field describes the entire group)For example: 
{\shpgrp … {yshp … Eand all sub-items as usualF } 
       {yshp … Eand all sub-items as usualF } 
Note {\shpgrp …} can be substituted for {yshp …} to create groups inside groupsK 
ysn aestination for a drawing property name Esee table in arawing lbject mropertiesF 
ysp aestination for a drawing property and takes a D{D ysn…D}{D ysv…D}D group pairK 
ysv aestination for a drawing property value

73d33406d3a33400 }} 
\hsv Destination for theme color information. 
 
With the exception of \shplidN, the control words listed in the preceding table do not apply for 
shapes that are within a group. For more information about groups, see the Introduction section 
of this specification. 
Drawing Object Properties 
The bulk of a drawing object is defined as a series of properties. The {\shp … control word is 
followed by {\*\shpinst, followed, in turn, by a list of all the properties of a shape. Each of the 
properties is in the following format: 
{\sp{\sn PropertyName}{\sv PropertyValueInformation}{\*\hsv AccentandTintandShadeInformation}} 
The control word for the drawing object property is \sp. Each property has a pairing of the 
name (\sn) and value (\sv) control words placed in the shape property group. For example, 
the vertical flip property is represented as: 
{\sp{\sn fFlipV}{\sv 1}} 
Here, the name of the property is fFlipV and the value is 1, which indicates True. All shape 
properties follow this basic format. Only properties that have been explicitly set for a shape are Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Shapes

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
written out in RTF. Other properties assume the default values (a property may be set to the 
default value explicitly).  
The \*\hsv destination holds the theme information for a shape color (color, tint, and shade). 
If the value is not a color or the shape color is not a themed color, this control word will not be 
written. This control word is always preceded by a non-theme equivalent color, so that theme-
unaware applications can read what the given color evaluates to while safely ignoring the theme 
control words new to Word 2007. 
For example, consider the partial RTF for a rectangle filled with the pink color. In this example, 
pink is also a theme color so \hsv is also written with the theme color information, consisting of 
which theme color (\caccentone), and the tint (\ctintN), and shade (\cshadeN) 
{\shp{\*\shpinst{\sp{\sn shapeType}{\sv 1}}{\sp{\sn fillColor}{\sv 9189631}{\*\hsv 
\caccentone\ctint255\cshade255}}{\shprslt}}} 
 
The drawing object properties are grouped into the categories:  
Position Relative Positioning Properties Rehydration 
Object Type Lock Text Box 
Ink Information Signature Lines WordArt Effects 
Picture Geometry Grouped Shapes 
Fill Line Shadow 
3D Effects Perspective Callout 
Connectors Drawing Canvases & Diagrams Black and White Modes

c3DOriginX The following c3DOriginY and c3DSkewAngle values 
define the origin relative to the viewpoint origin 
measured. 
These values are 16.16 numbers that specify the 
position of the origin within the shape bounding box, as 
multiples of the width and height of that bounding box 
and relative to the center (that is, they are displaced 
from the center) When these values are applied the 
actual transformed shape path is used, rather than the 
shape geometry (compare with the shadow and 
perspective values that work on the geometry bounding 
box, not the actual points) This means that a shape 
that extends outside the geometry bounding box (such 
as a text effect) is handled “correctly” for the calculation 
of the P-a originK

Word’s RTF reader recognizes \hrule to mean insert a horizontal rule with default properties at 
the end of the document. It is ignored elsewhere in the document and Word writes a horizontal 
line shape instead of \hrule. 
The format of the value depends on the property name it is paired with. Many values are simple 
single numbers. Distances are expressed in EMU units (English-metric units). Fractional or fixed 
values are expressed using units that are 1/65536th of a whole. Angles are expressed as 
fractions of a degree. Colors are 24-bit color values. Booleans have two possible values: 1 for 
True and 0 for False.  
Arrays are formatted as a sequence of numbers separated by semicolons. The first number tells 
the size of each element in the array in bytes. The number of bytes per element may be 2, 4, or 
8. When the size of the element is 8, each element is represented as a group of two numbers. 
The second number tells the number of elements in the array. For example, the points of a 
square polygon are written as: 
{sv 8;4;{0,0};{100,0};{100,100};{0,100}}

The following keywords are related to defining a hyperlink hanging off a shape, that is, all of 
them are inside a {\sp{\sn …}{\sv …}}. These specifically can occur in the \sp to define a 
property that is a hyperlink. They are used in the following way: 
{\hl {\hlloc RTF-string }{\hlsrc RTF-string}{\hlfr RTF-string}} 
The three groups can be in any order and provide the three strings needed to fully describe a 
hyperlink. The control words are described in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\hl Destination for hyperlink attached to a shape. 
\hlloc Location string for hyperlink. 
\hlsrc Source string for hyperlink. 
\hlfr Display name for hyperlink. 
 
 
  
Footnotes 
The \footnote control word introduces a footnote. Footnotes are destinations in RTF. A footnote 
is anchored to the character that immediately precedes the footnote destination (that is, the 
footnote moves with the character to which it is anchored). If automatic footnote numbering is 
defined, the destination can be preceded by a footnote reference character, identified by the 
control word \chftn. Microsoft products do not support footnotes within headers, footers, or 
comments (annotations). Placing a footnote within headers, footers, or comments will often 
result in a corrupted document. 
Footnotes have the following syntax: 
<footnote> '{' \footnote \ftnalt? <para>+ '}' 
Here is an example of a destination containing footnotes: 
\ftnbj\ftnrestart \sectd \linemod0\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain 
\ri1170 \fs20 {\pu6 Mead's landmark study has been amply annotated.\chftn 
{\footnote \pard\plain \s246 \fs20 {\up6\chftn }See Sahlins, Bateson, and  
Geertz for a complete bibliography.}

the basis for the paper. As others have noted, \chftn Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Footnotes, Fields, etc.

{\footnote \pard\plain \s246 \fs20 {\up6\chftn}

this period was a turning point for Margaret Mead.} 
\par 
To indicate endnotes, the following combination is emitted: \footnote\ftnalt. Existing readers 
will ignore the \ftnalt control word and treat everything as a footnote.  
For other control words relating to footnotes, see the sections titled Document Formatting 
Properties, Section Formatting Properties, and Special Characters in this specification.  
Comments (Annotations) 
RTF comments (annotations) have two parts; the author ID (introduced by the control word 
\atnid) and the comment text (introduced by the control word \annotation) there is no group 
enclosing both parts. Microsoft products do not support comments within headers, footers, or 
footnotes. Placing a comment within headers, footers, or footnotes may result in a corrupted 
document. Each part of the comment is an RTF destination. Comments are anchored to the 
character that immediately precedes the comment. 
If an annotation is associated with an annotation bookmark, the following two destination 
control words precede and follow the bookmark. The alphanumeric string N, such as a long 
integer, represents the bookmark name. 
<atrfstart> '{\*' \atrfstart N '}' 
<atrfend> '{\*' \atrfend N '}' 
 
Comments have the following syntax: 
<annot> <annotid> <atnauthor> <atntime>? \chatn <atnicn>? <annotdef>  
<annotid> '{\*' \atnid #PCDATA '}' 
<atnauthor> '{\*' \atnauthor #PCDATA '}' 
<annotdef> '{\*' \annotation <atndate>? <atnref> <atnparent> <para>+ '}' 
<atnref> '{\*' \atnrefN '}' 
<atntime> '{\*' \atntime <time> '}' 
<atndate> '{\*' \atndate <date> '}' 
<atnparent> '{\*' \atnparent <annotid of parent> '}' 
<atnicn> '{\*' \atnicn <pict> '}' 
 
The following is an example of annotation text: 
{\insrsid8729657 An example of a paradigm might be Darwinian biology.}{\cs15\v\fs16\insrsid8729657

}{\insrsid9244585 How about some examples that deal with social science? That is what this paper is 
about.}}}  
Comments may have optional time stamps (contained in the \atntime destination), date 
stamps (contained in the \atndate destination) or icons (contained in the \atnicn 
destination).  Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Footnotes, Fields, etc.

Fields 
The \field control word introduces a field destination, which contains the text of fields. Fields 
have the following syntax: 
<field> '{' \field <fieldmod>? <fieldinst> <fieldrslt> '}' 
<fieldmod> \flddirty? & \fldedit? & \fldlock? & \fldpriv? 
<fieldinst> '{\*' \fldinst <fieldtype><para>+ \fldalt? <datafield>? <formfield>? '}'

<formula> See Office Open XML, Section 2.15.3. 
 
For detailed discussion of the <para>+ content in <fieldinst>, please see Office Open XML, 
Section 2.15. There are several control words that alter the interpretation of the field. These 
control words are listed in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\field Destination for a field. 
\flddirty A formatting change has been made to the field result since the field was last updated. 
\fldedit Text has been added to, or removed from, the field result since the field was last updated. 
\fldlock Field is locked and cannot be updated. 
\fldpriv Result is not in a form suitable for display (for example, binary data used by fields whose result is 
a picture). 
 
Two sub destinations are required within the \field destination. They must be enclosed in 
braces ({ }) and begin with the following control words. 
Control word Meaning 
\*\fldinst Field instructions. This is a destination control word. 
\fldrslt Most recent calculated result of the field. This is a destination control word.

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
If the instruction for a field contains a file name, then the \cpgN control can be used to define 
the character set of the file name. See Code Page Support in this specification for details. 
The \fldrslt control word should be included even if a result was not calculated because most 
readers (even those readers that do not recognize fields) can generally include the value of the 
\fldrslt destination in the document. A field result should not start with a table, because it may 
break some RTF readers. 
The following is an example of some field text: 
{\field {\*\fldinst AUTHOR \\*MERGEFORMAT}{\fldrslt Joe Smith}}\par\pard 
{\field{\*\fldinst time \\@ "h:mm AM/PM"}{\fldrslt 8:12 AM}} 
 
You can use the \fldalt control word to specify that the given field reference is to an endnote. 
For example, the following field in RTF is a reference to a footnote 
{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber }{\fldrslt 1}} 
The following is an example of a reference to an endnote 
{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber \fldalt}{\fldrslt I}} 
If the specified field is a form field, the \*\datafield destination appears as a part of 
<fieldinst> and contains the binary data of a form field instruction. For example: 
{\field{\*\fldinst {\*\bkmkstart Text1} FORMTEXT {{\*\datafield  
00000000000000000554657874310008476565207768697a0000000000000000000000}}}{\fldrslt Default 
Result}}{\*\bkmkend Text1} 
Note the \datafield destination requires the \* prefix. The \fldtype, \date, \time, and \wpeqn field keywords 
should be ignored. 
 
An example of the AUTONUM field for ①. is 
   {\field{\*\fldinst AUTONUM \\* CircleNum}{\fldrslt \f31505 \u9312\’3f\f31506 .}} 
An example of a HYPERLINK field is 
   {\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "http://www.microsoft.com"}{\fldrslt Microsoft}} 
This displays as Microsoft without any coloring since none is specified in the “friendly name” 
result portion of the field (in the {\fldrslt …}). But you can click on it to go to Microsoft’s web 
site. More detailed discussion of the HYPERLINK field is given in Office Open XML, Section 
2.15.5.26. 
EQ field and East Asian Formatting 
The EQ field is explained in Office Open XML, 2.15.5.20. For the most part, this field is seldom 
used, since the Equation Editor and Word 2007 math editing and display facilities are far 
superior. But it’s still used for three East Asian formatting constructs: phonetic guide, enclose, 
and combine. The two other East Asian formatting constructs that Word supports, \twoinoneN 
(sometimes called Warichu) and \horzvertN (sometimes called tatenakayoko) have their own 
RTF and underlying implementations. 
This subsection discusses how the phonetic-guide, enclose and combine constructs are created 
using the Word EQ field using the EQ function \o(<this>,<that>), which displays <this> over Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Footnotes, Fields, etc.

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
<that>. The major difference between the three constructs is the displacement of the <this> 
relative to the <that>. 
Consider first the phonetic guide, which is often call ruby. This displays a ruby-text annotation 
(<ruby>) in a smaller type size above, below, or to the side of a base text (<base>). The ruby 
text is used to clarify the base text in some way, typically how the base text is pronounced. 
When Japanese text is displayed from left to right (instead of vertically), the ruby text is 
displayed above or below the base text. The ruby text can have various justifications.  
For example, the ruby construct 日本語
にほんご displays the Japanese for the term "Japanese 
language", 日本語, together with the Hiragana ruby text にほんご, which is how to pronounce 
"Japanese language" in Japanese.  
To display this construct with the EQ field, add the field switches and EQ functions  
\* jcN  \* "Font:MS Mincho" \* hpsN \o\ad(\s\upN(<ruby>),<base>) 
Here the N of the jcN switch specifies the kind of ruby justification as defined in the table 
 
N Meaning 
0 Center <ruby> with respect to <base> 
1 Distribute difference in space between longer and shorter text in the 
latter, evenly between each character 
2 Distribute difference in space between longer and shorter text in the 
latter using a ratio of 1:2:1 which corresponds to lead : inter-
character : end 
3 Align <ruby> with the left of <base> 
4 Align <ruby> with the right of <base> 
5 Display <ruby> vertically to the right of <base>, regardless of the 
<base> alignment 
 
The \* "Font:..." specifies the font and the \* hpsN specifies the number of half points to use for 
the ruby text size. The \ad switch for the \o function says to use the distributed justification 
defined by the jcN entry. The \s\upN(...) is the EQ shift function that shifts its argument up if 
the \upN switch is used and down if the \doN switch is used. To display <ruby> above <base>, 
use \upN and to display <ruby> below <base>, use \doN. Here N is the number of points to 
shift. Note that (half) points don’t scale with the text size, so the parameters have to be 
recalculated if a change in text size is desired. 
For the combine formatting construct, the characters to be combined are split into two groups, 
<above> and <below>. The corresponding Word EQ field contains something like 
\o(\s\up5(<above>),\s\do2(<below>) 
where the font size is chosen to be 6 pts (\fs12) This construct displays <above> over <below>, 
sort of the way ruby displays <ruby> over <base>, but for the combine construct <above> isn’t 
shifted up so far and <below> is shifted down a bit. As for the ruby construct, since the shifts 
are in points, the combine structure doesn’t scale with text size correctly. For example, 
combining abcd, we get ab,cd, which has the EQ field "eq \o(\s\up 5(ab)\s\do 2(cd)". 
For the enclose construct that looks like Ⓠ, the EQ field can contain 
\o\ac(\uc0\u9675,Q) Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 Footnotes, Fields, etc.

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
where 967510 = 25CB16, i.e., a white circle. Here \ac switch means center align one argument 
over the other (note that there’s no \s() object and hence no vertical shift) and we include \uc0 
to get rid of the multibyte translation that would otherwise follow \u9675. 
When encoding these EQ fields in RTF, one has to duplicate every backslash, so that the 
backslash is taken literally instead of the start of a control word. For example, the "enclose" EQ 
field above could be represented by the RTF 
{\field{\*\fldinst EQ \\o\\ac(\\fs24\\uc0\\u9675,\\fs16 Q)\fldrslt}} 
This structure also doesn’t scale with font size, since the white circle and the Q must have 
appropriate relative font sizes.  
Note: Word’s RTF for EQ fields always has a null field result (empty \fldrslt), so if a reader of the RTF doesn’t 
understand the EQ \fldinst, it displays nothing for the field. 
Form Fields 
Form fields occur inside the field \fldinst group and describe the properties of form controls. 
They have the syntax  
<formfield> '{\*' \formfield '{' <formparams> <formstrings> '}}' 
<formparams> \fftypeN? \ffownhelpN? \ffownstatN? \ffprotN? \ffsizeN? \fftypetxtN? \ffrecalcN? 
\ffhaslistboxN? \ffhaslistboxN? \ffmaxlenN? \ffhpsN? \ffdefresN? \ffresN?  
<formstrings> <ffname>? <ffdeftext>? <ffformat>? <ffhelptext>? <ffstattext>? <ffentrymcr>? <ffexitmcr>?

\*\ffentrymcr Macro to execute upon entry into this form field (string) This is a destination control word. 
\*\ffexitmcr Macro to execute upon exit from this form field (string) This is a destination control word. 
 
Index Entries 
The \xe control word introduces an index entry. Index entries in RTF are destinations. An index 
entry has the following syntax: 
<idx> '{' \xe (\xefN? & \bxe? & \ixe?) <entry> (<txe> | <rxe>)? '}' 
<entry> (<char>+ <yxe>?)| ('{' <char>+ <yxe>? '}') 
<yxe> \yxe <char>+ #PCDATA 
<txe> '{' \txe <char>+ #PCDATA '}' 
<rxe> '{' \rxe #PCDATA '}' 
<pxe> '\*' \pxe <char>+ #PCDATA 
 
If the text of the index entry is not formatted as hidden text with the \v control word, then the 
text is put into the document as well as into the index. Similarly, the text of the \txe sub 
destination, described later in this section, becomes part of the document if it is not formatted 
as hidden text. For more information on the \v control word, see Font/Character Formatting 
Properties in this specification.

Control word Meaning 
\xefN Allows multiple indexes within the same document. N is an integer that corresponds to the 
ASCII value of a letter between A and Z. 
\bxe Formats page number or cross-reference in bold. 
\ixe Formats page number or cross-reference in italic. 
\txe Text argument to be used instead of a page number. This is a destination control word. 
\rxe  Text argument is a bookmark for the range of page numbers. This is a destination control 
word. 
\yxe Pronunciation (or heading) for index entry, used in phonetic sorting. 
\*\pxe “vomi” EpronunciationF for index entryK 
Table of Contents Entries 
The \tc control word introduces a table of contents entry, which can be used to build the actual 
table of contents. The \tcn control word marks a table of contents entry that will not have a 
page number associated with it; this is used in place of \tc for such entries. Table of contents 
entries are destinations, and they have the following syntax: 
<toc> '{' \tc | \tcn (\tcfN? & \tclN?) <char>+ '}' 
As with index entries, text that is not formatted as hidden with the \v character-formatting 
control word is put into the document. The following control words can also be used in this 
destination. 
Control word Meaning 
\tcfN Type of table being compiled. N is mapped by existing Microsoft software to a letter between A 
and Z (default is 67, which maps to C, used for tables of contents) 
\tclN Level number (default is 1) 
 
Bidirectional Language Support 
RTF supports bidirectional writing orders for languages such as Arabic. The controls are 
described in the following table (as well as in the appropriate sections throughout this 
specification). Also refer to the associated character properties defined in Associated Character 
Properties in this specification. 
All the control words relating to bidirectional language support are repeated here for 
convenience. 
Control word Meaning 
\rtlch The character data following this control word will be treated as a right-to-left run. 
\ltrch The character data following this control word will be treated as a left-to-right run (the default) 
\linN Left indent for left-to-right paragraphs; right indent for right-to-left paragraphs (default is 0) 
\rinN Right indent for left-to-right paragraphs; left indent for right-to-left paragraphs (default is 0) 
\pgnbidia Page-number format is Abjad Jawaz if language is Arabic and Biblical Standard if language is 
Hebrew. 
\pgnbidib Page number format is Alif Ba Tah if language is Arabic and Non-standard Decimal if language is

East Asian Support 
Word 2000 and subsequent releases provide full support for all East Asian features introduced in 
all previous Asian versions of Word and they have the ability to read and write RTF keywords 
related to such features. This section provides details on the handling of East Asian characters. 
For more information on handling East Asian features, see the appropriate subsection in the 
Contents of an RTF File section in this document. See also EQ field and East Asian Formatting. 
Escaped Expressions 
An escaped expression (for example, \'hh, \\, or \{) is usable in all RTF control words. 
In general RTF should be written out with all characters above 0x7F in the escaped form, \'hh 
or the \uN form if an ANSI version doesn’t exist. The following table shows values for character 
codes. 
Character code Write out as 
0x00 <= ch < 0x20 Escaped (\'hh) 
0x20 <= ch < 0x80 Raw (non-escaped) character 
0x80 <= ch <= 0xFF Escaped (\'hh) 
0x5C, 0x7B, 0x7D (special 
RTF characters \,{, }) 
Escaped (\'hh) 
 
When an RTF reader encounters raw characters in the leading-byte range of the double-byte 
character, it regards the next character as the trailing byte of the double-byte character and 
combines the two characters into one double-byte character. The following table shows possible 
byte combinations. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 East Asian RTF 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 201 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
Leading byte Trailing byte Validity 
Escaped Raw (0x20 <= ch <= 0x7f)  Valid (standard format for double-byte character) 
Escaped Escaped (other) Valid (standard format for double-byte character) 
Raw Raw Valid (RTF-J format for double-byte character) 
Raw Escaped Invalid 
 
Note: Characters that are special RTF symbols (\,{, or }) should always be escaped, preferably using the \'hh 
syntax, since some readers may have trouble with \\, \{, or \}. 
Character Set and Mapping 
Word specifies the character set in the font table using \fcharsetN. Word interprets \cpg437 
as \fcharset0 and \cpg932 as \fcharset128 if it encounters these control words when 
reading RTF. 
Word maps single-byte characters according to character set information (for example, 
Macintosh to ANSI) and leaves double-byte characters unmapped. 
Font Family 
RTF control words Definition and interpretation in Word 
\jis   RTF uses \jis as a control word for character set. Word interprets this as 
\ansi, which is the default character set used if the character set is not 
defined. 
\fjminchou and \fjgothic RTF uses \fjminchou and \fjgothic to specify font family. Word interprets 
these as \fnil, which is the default font family. 
ShiftJIS Font Without \cpgN or \fcharsetN 
If \cpgN or \fcharsetN control words are not present, Word uses the text metrics of the font 
to determine the character set of these fonts. 
Composite Fonts (Associated Fonts for International Runs) 
Word defines control words to specify composite fonts as associated character properties. These 
control words follow the rule of associated character properties and understand font designation 
(\afN) All other <aprops> are ignored in Word. In an East Asian context (see Associated 
Character Properties for the general case) composite fonts have the following syntax: 
<atext> <losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun> 
<losbrun> \hich \afN & <aprops> \dbch \afN & <aprops> \loch <ptext> 
<hisbrun> \loch \afN & <aprops> \dbch \afN & <aprops> \hich <ptext> 
<dbrun> \loch \afN & <aprops> \hich \afN & <aprops> \dbch <ptext> 
These control words are described in the following table. 
Control word Meaning 
\loch Specifies a run of the characters in the low-ANSI (0x00–0x7F) area. 
\hich For the characters in the high-ANSI (0x80–-0xFF) area. 
\dbch Specifies a run of the double-byte characters.

Word writes out associated character properties in the styles. In the style sheet, the <dbrun> 
definition should be used for compatibility with applications that have transparent readers. 
{\stylesheet{\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;}} 
If the composite font definition matches the style, only the control word (\loch, \hich, or 
\dbch)is used to distinguish the type of run, along with the font information for transparent 
readers. 
{\fonttbl{\f5\fswiss\fcharset0\fprq2 Arial;}{\f27\froman\fcharset128\fprq1 Mincho;}} 
{\stylesheet{\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;}} 
\pard\plain 
{\dbch\f27\fs20 \’82\’b1\’82\’ea\’82\’cd} 
{\loch\f5 Test } 
{\dbch\f27\’82\’c5\’82\’b7\’81B} 
\par} 
If one or all of \loch, \hich, and \dbch are missing from the style sheet definition (or the 
character set does not match), Word applies the following fonts to each character run in the 
style using the bulleted rules in the next paragraph. 
Control word Font Word J applies 
\loch Same font as \fN. 
\hich Any font whose character set is ANSI_CHARSET. 
\dbch Any font whose character set is SHIFTJIS_CHARSET. 
 
If the composite font control words are missing from the character run, Word will interpret all 
characters below 0x80 as a \loch run. Characters above or equal to 0x80 are determined using 
the following rules: 
 If the character is in the leading-byte range and the net character is in the trailing-byte 
range of a double-byte character, it is treated as a \dbch run (one double-byte character). For 
example, 
\’99\’47 → 
 
 If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character but the net 
character is not in the trailing-byte range, it is treated as a \hich run (two high-ANSI or low-
ANSI characters). For example, 
\’99\’FF → ÿ 
 If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character and is the last 
character in the run, it is treated as a \hich run (one high-ANSI character). For example, 
\’99\par → 
 If the character is not in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character, it is treated 
as a \hich run (one high-ANSI character). For example, 
\’FF → ÿ Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 East Asian RTF

Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application 
This appendix gives the source code for a sample RTF reader program. 
Note The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or any other type of 
support for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF specification. 
How to Write an RTF Reader 
There are three basic things that an RTF reader must do: 
Separate text from RTF controls. 
Parse an RTF control. 
Dispatch an RTF control. 
Separating text from RTF controls is relatively simple, because all RTF controls begin with a 
backslash. Therefore, any incoming character that is not a backslash is text and will be handled 
as text. 
Parsing an RTF control is also relatively simple. An RTF control is either (a) a sequence of 
alphabetical characters followed by an optional numeric parameter, or (b) a single non-
alphanumeric character. 
Dispatching an RTF control, on the other hand, is relatively complicated. A recursive-descent 
parser tends to be overly strict because RTF is intentionally vague about the order of various 
properties relative to one another. However, whatever method you use to dispatch an RTF 
control, your RTF reader should do the following: 
Ignore control words you do not understand or do not want to implement.  
Many RTF readers fail when they come across an unknown RTF control. Because Microsoft is Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
continually adding new RTF controls, this limits an RTF reader to working with the RTF from one 
particular product (usually some version of Word for Windows). 
Always understand \* 
One of the most important things an RTF reader can do is to understand the \* control. This 
control introduces a destination that is not part of the document. It tells the RTF reader that if 
the reader does not understand the next control word, then it should skip the entire enclosing 
group. 
 Remember that binary data can occur when you’re skipping RTF. 
A simple way to skip a group in RTF is to keep a running count of the opening 
braces the RTF reader has encountered in the RTF stream. When the RTF reader 
sees an opening brace, it increments the count. When the reader sees a closing 
brace, it decrements the count. When the count becomes negative, the end of the 
group was found. Unfortunately, this does not work when the RTF file contains a 
\binN control; the reader must explicitly check each control word found to see if it 
is a \binN control, and if found, skip that many bytes before resuming its scanning 
for braces. 
A Sample RTF Reader Implementation 
This implementation uses a table-driven approach to reading RTF. The approach allows the most 
flexibility in reading RTF but makes it difficult to detect incorrect RTF. This reader works exactly 
as described in the RTF specification and uses the principles of operation described within the 
RTF specification. This reader is designed to be simple to understand but is not intended to be 
efficient or all inclusive. This RTF reader also implements the three design principles listed in the 
previous section. 
The RTF reader consists of the following four files: 
 rtfdecl.h, prototypes for all functions in the RTF reader 
 rtftype.h, types used in the RTF reader 
 rtfreadr.c, main program, the main loop of the RTF reader, and the RTF control 
parser 
 rtfactn.c, dispatch routines for the RTF reader 
rtfdecl.h  
rtfdecl.h is straightforward and requires little explanation. 
rtfreadr.c 
Like rtfdecl.h, rtfreadr.c is also reasonably straightforward. The function ecRtfParse separates 
text from RTF controls and handles text, and the function ecParseRtfKeyword parses an RTF 
control and also collects any parameter that follows the RTF control. 
rtftype.h 
rtftype.h begins by declaring a sample set of character, paragraph, section, and document 
properties. These structures are present to demonstrate how the dispatch routines can modify 
any particular property and are not actually used to format text. 
For example, the following enumeration describes the destination to which the text should be 
routed to: 
typedef enum { rdsNorm, rdsSkip } RDS; Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader 
© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Page 210 
By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
Because this is just a sample RTF reader, there are only two destinations. A more complicated 
reader would add an entry to this enumeration for each destination supported [for example, 
headers, footnotes, endnotes, comments (annotations), bookmarks, and pictures. 
The following enumeration describes the internal state of the RTF parser: 
typedef enum { risNorm, risBin, risHex } RIS; 
This is entirely separate from the state of the dispatch routines and the destination state; other 
RTF readers may not necessarily have anything similar to this. 
The following structure encapsulates the state that must be saved at a group start and restored 
at a group end: 
typedef struct save 
{ 
struct save *pNext; 
CHP chp; 
PAP pap; 
SEP sep; 
DOP dop; 
RDS rds; 
RIS ris; 
} SAVE; 
The following enumeration describes a set of classes for RTF controls: 
typedef enum {kwdChar, kwdDest, kwdProp, kwdSpec} KWD; 
 Use kwdChar for controls that represent special characters (such as \-, \{, or 
\}) 
 Use kwdDest for controls that introduce RTF destinations. 
 Use kwdProp for controls that modify some sort of property. 
 Use kwdSpec for controls that need to run some specialized code. 
The following enumeration defines the number of PROP structures (described later) that will be 
used. There will typically be an iprop for every field in the character, paragraph, section, and 
document properties. 
typedef enum {ipropBold, ipropItalic, ipropUnderline, ipropLeftInd, 
ipropRightInd, ipropFirstInd, ipropCols, ipropPgnX, ipropPgnY, 
ipropXaPage, ipropYaPage, ipropXaLeft, ipropXaRight, 
ipropYaTop, ipropYaBottom, ipropPgnStart, ipropSbk,  
ipropPgnFormat, ipropFacingp, ipropLandscape, ipropJust,

The following structure is a very compact way to describe how to locate the address of a 
particular value in one of the property structures: Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader

typedef enum {actnSpec, actnByte, actnWord} ACTN; 
typedef enum {propChp, propPap, propSep, propDop} PROPTYPE; 
typedef struct propmod 
{ 
ACTN actn; 
PROPTYPE prop; 
int offset; 
} PROP; 
 
The actn field describes the width of the value being described: if the value is a byte, then actn 
is actnByte; if the value is a word, then actn is actnWord; if the value is neither a byte nor a 
word, then you can use actnSpec to indicate that some C code needs to be run to set the value. 
The prop field indicates the property structure that is being described; propChp indicates that 
the value is located within the CHP structure; propPap indicates that the value is located within 
the PAP structure. Finally, the offset field contains the offset of the value from the start of the 
structure. The offsetof() macro is usually used to initialize this field. 
The following structure describes how to parse a particular RTF control: 
typedef enum {ipfnBin, ipfnHex, ipfnSkipDest } IPFN; 
typedef enum {idestPict, idestSkip } IDEST; 
typedef struct symbol 
{ 
char *szKeyword; 
int dflt; 
bool fPassDflt; 
KWD kwd; 
int idx; 
} SYM; 
szKeyword points to the RTF control being described; kwd describes the class of the particular 
RTF control (described earlier) dflt is the default value for this control, and fPassDflt should be 
nonzero if the value in dflt should be passed to the dispatch routine.  
Note: fPassDflt is only nonzero for control words that normally set a particular value. For 
example, the various section break controls typically have nonzero fPassDflt controls, but 
controls that take parameters should not. 
Idx is a generalized index; its use depends on the kwd being used for this control. 
 If kwd is kwdChar, then idx is the character that should be output. 
 If kwd is kwdDest, then idx is the idest for the new destination. 
 If kwd is kwdProp, then idx is the iprop for the appropriate property. 
 If kwd is kwdSpec, then idx is an ipfn for the appropriate function. 
With this structure it is very simple to dispatch an RTF control word. Once the reader isolates 
the RTF control word and its (possibly associated) value, the reader then searches an array of Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader

SYM structures to find the RTF control word. If the control word is not found, the RTF reader 
ignores it, unless the previous control was \*, in which case the reader must scan past an entire 
group. 
If the control word is found, the reader then uses the kwd value from the SYM structure to 
determine what to do. This is, in fact, exactly what the function ecTranslateKeyword in the file 
RTFACTN.C does.  
rtfactn.c 
Rtfactn.c contains the tables describing the properties and control words, and the routines to 
evaluate properties (ecApplyPropChange) and to dispatch control words 
(ecTranslateKeyword) 
The tables are the keys to understanding the RTF dispatch routines. The following are some 
sample entries from both tables, along with a brief explanation of each entry. 
Property Table  
This table must have an entry for every iprop.  
actnByte,   propChp,    offsetof(CHP, fBold) 
This property says that the ipropBold property is a byte parameter bound to chp.fBold. 
actnWord,   propPap,    offsetof(PAP, xaRight) 
This property says that ipropRightInd is a word parameter bound to pap.xaRight. 
actnWord,   propSep,    offsetof(SEP, cCols) 
This property says that ipropCols is a word parameter bound to sep.cCols. 
actnSpec,   propChp,    0,                          // ipropPlain 
This property says that ipropPlain is a special parameter. Instead of directly evaluating it, 
ecApplyPropChange will run some custom C code to apply a property change. 
Control Word Table 
"b",        1,      fFalse,     kwdProp,    ipropBold, 
This structure says that the control \b sets the ipropBold property. Because fPassDflt is False, 
the RTF reader only uses the default value if the control does not have a parameter. If no 
parameter is provided, the RTF reader uses a value of 1. 
"sbknone",  sbkNon, fTrue,      kwdProp,    ipropSbk, 
This entry says that the control \sbknone sets the ipropSbk property. Because fPassDflt is 
True, the RTF reader always uses the default value of \sbknone, even if the control has a 
parameter. 
"par",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x0a, 
This entry says that the control \par is equivalent to a 0x0a (line feed) character. 
"tab",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x09, 
This entry says that the control \tab is equivalent to a 0x09 (tab) character. 
"bin",      0,      fFalse,     kwdSpec,    ipfnBin, 
This entry says that the control \bin should run some C code. The particular piece of C code can 
be located by the ipfnBin parameter. Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader

"fonttbl",  0,      fFalse,     kwdDest,    idestSkip, 
This entry says that the control \fonttbl should change to the destination idestSkip. 
Notes on Implementing Other RTF Features 
The table-driven approach to dispatching RTF controls used by the sample converter does not 
implement any syntax checking. For most controls this is not a problem; a control modifies the 
appropriate property. However, some controls, such as those for tabs and borders, are 
dependent on other control words either before or after the current control word. 
There are some standard techniques for handling these features. 
Tabs and Other Control Sequences Terminating in a Fixed Control 
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global structure that 
represents the current state of the tab descriptor (or other entity). As the modifiers come in, 
they modify the various fields of the global structure. When the fixed control at the end of the 
sequence is dispatched, it adds the entire descriptor and reinitializes the global variable. 
Borders and Other Control Sequences Beginning with a Fixed Control 
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global pointer that is 
initialized when the fixed control is dispatched. The controls that modify the fixed control then 
modify fields pointed to by the global pointer. 
Other Problem Areas in RTF 
Style Sheets 
Style sheets can be handled as destinations. However, styles have default values, just as every 
other control does. RTF readers should be sure to handle a missing style control as the default 
style value (that is, 0). 
Property Changes 
Some RTF readers use various bits of RTF syntax to mark property changes. In particular, they 
assume that property changes will occur only after a group start, which is not correct. Because 
there is a variety of ways to represent identical property changes in RTF, RTF readers should 
review the changes in the properties and not at any particular way of representing a property 
change. In particular, properties can be changed explicitly with a control word or implicitly at the 
end of a group. For example, these three sequences of RTF have exactly the same semantics, 
and should be translated identically: 
{\b bold \i Bold Italic \i0 Bold again} 
{\b bold {\i Bold Italic }Bold again} 
{\b bold \i Bold Italic \plain\b Bold again} 
Fields 
All versions of Microsoft Word for Windows and version 6.0 and later of Microsoft Word for the 
Macintosh have fields. If you are writing an RTF reader and expect to do anything with fields, 
keep the following notes in mind: 
 Field instructions may have arbitrary amounts of character formatting and 
arbitrarily nested groups. While the groups will be properly nested within the field 
instructions, you may already be inside an arbitrary number of groups by the time Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1 RTF Reader

By using or providing feedback on these materials, you agree to the license agreement on p. 1. 
 
you know the field you are working with. If you then expect to be able to skip to the 
end of the field instructions, you’ll have to know how many groups have started so 
that you can skip to the end properly. 
 Some fields, the INCLUDE field in particular, can have section breaks in the field 
results. If this occurs, then the text after the end of the field does not have the 
same section properties as the text at the start of the field. Therefore, the section 
properties must not be restored when the field results contain section breaks. 
Tables 
Tables are probably the hardest part of RTF to read and write correctly. Because of the way 
Microsoft word processors implement tables, and the table-driven approach of many Microsoft 
RTF readers, it is very easy to write tables in RTF that are not compatible with Microsoft word 
processors when you try to read the RTF. Here are some guidelines to reduce problems with 
tables in RTF: 
 Place the entire table definition before any paragraph properties, including \pard. 
 Verify that the number of cells in the RTF matches the number of cell definitions. 
 Some controls must be the same in all paragraphs in a row. In particular, all 
paragraphs in a row must have the same positioning controls, and all paragraphs in 
a row must have \intbl specified. 
 Do not use the \sbys control inside a table. \sbys is a holdover from Word for MS-
DOS and early versions of Word for the Macintosh. Word for Windows and current 
versions of Word for the Macintosh translate \sbys as a table.  
 Cell definitions starting before the left margin of the paper begins (that is, the 
parameter plus the left margin is negative) are always in error.

Appendix B: Index of RTF Control Words 
The control word table contains a list of each RTF control word, the name of the section where it 
may be found, and its type. The types are described in the following table. 
 
Type Meaning 
Flag This control word ignores any parameter. 
Destination This control word starts a group or destination. It ignores any parameter. 
Symbol This control word represents a special character. 
Toggle This control word distinguishes between the ON and OFF states for the given 
property. The control word with no parameter or a nonzero parameter is used 
to turn on the property, while the control word with a zero parameter is used 
to turn it off. 
Value This control word requires a parameter. 
Note: In the following table, the names of all control words added in version 95 or later are flagged with the version 
number in which they were added (95, 97, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007) Control words defined in the 1987 RTF 
Specification are flagged with 87. More control words were in Word 3.0 for the Apple Macintosh in 1987, but the 
basic destinations are defined in the specification. For the Word 2007 Compatibility Pack, many control words that 
were added by Word 2007 had to be ported back to Word 2003 and Word 2002 via patches. So there are quite a 
few control words flagged with 2007 that can now be recognized by the older Word versions.

Appendix C: Control Words Introduced by Specific/Other Microsoft 
Products 
Pocket Word and RichEdit 
Control word Meaning 
\disabled Character formatting property used by RichEdit to mark text runs as disabled. \disabled turns 
on the disabled effect and \disabled0 turns it off. 
\protect Character formatting flag used by RichEdit to mark text runs as protected. Introduced for Outlook 
97. \protect turns on protection and \protect0 turns it off. 
\pwdN Substitute for \rtfN. Introduced by Pocket Word to distinguish its files from general RTF files. 
Currently only 1 is emitted and the number is ignored by the RTF reader. 
\urtfN Identifies an RTF file in which all text characters are encoded in UTF-8. Only binary data escapes 
this transformation. Word does not read this encoding of RTF. 
Exchange (Used in RTF ↔ HTML Conversions) 
Control word Meaning 
\*\htmltagN Indicates that the destination is encapsulated HTML text (to be ignored by RTF readers, but used 
during reverse RTF->HTML conversion) This keyword is followed by a numeric parameter 
containing encapsulation flags. 
\htmlrtfN Toggling keyword to mark pieces of RTF to be ignored during reverse RTF->HTML conversion. N  
missing or N = 1 turns effect on; N =0 turns it off. 
\*\mhtmltagN Indicates that the destination is an encapsulated tag with rewritten URL links that should be used 
in a conversion to plain HTML. Typically, URL links are rewritten as automatically generated 
MHTML reference names or as absolute external links. The keyword is followed by the flag 
parameter (the same one as for the \htmltagN keyword) 
\htmlbase  Placeholder in front of encapsulated MHTML reference name that marks the place where the base 
URL should be appended. This keyword is only used inside the \mhtmltag destination. 
Microsoft Office Outlook (Used in RTF E-Mail) 
Control word Meaning 
\*\ebcstart #PCDATA Specifies start of Electronic Business Card data. This is a destination control word.  
\*\ebcend #PCDATA Specifies end of Electronic Business Card data. This is a destination control word.
